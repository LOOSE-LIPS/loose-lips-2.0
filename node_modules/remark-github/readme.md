[**remark**][remark] plugin to automatically link references to commits, issues,
pull-requests, and users, like in GitHub issues, PRs, and comments (see [Writing
on GitHub][writing-on-github]).

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`micromark`](https://github.com/micromark/micromark),
see [`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
Version 10 works with old (12) and new (13+) remark!

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-github
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
Some references:

*   Commit: f8083175fe890cbf14f41d0a06e7aa35d4989587
*   Commit (fork): foo@f8083175fe890cbf14f41d0a06e7aa35d4989587
*   Commit (repo): remarkjs/remark@e1aa9f6c02de18b9459b7d269712bcb50183ce89
*   Issue or PR (`#`): #1
*   Issue or PR (`GH-`): GH-1
*   Issue or PR (fork): foo#1
*   Issue or PR (project): remarkjs/remark#1
*   Mention: @wooorm

Some links:

*   Commit: <https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/commit/e1aa9f6c02de18b9459b7d269712bcb50183ce89>
*   Commit comment: <https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/commit/ac63bc3abacf14cf08ca5e2d8f1f8e88a7b9015c#commitcomment-16372693>
*   Issue or PR: <https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/issues/182>
*   Issue or PR comment: <https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-github/issues/3#issue-151160339>
*   Mention: <https://github.com/ben-eb>
```

And our module, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import {readSync} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkGithub from 'remark-github'

const file = readSync('example.md')

remark()
  .use(remarkGithub)
  .process(file)
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
Some references:

###### Repository

These links are generated relative to a project.
In Node this is detected automatically by loading `package.json` and looking for
a `repository` field.
In the browser, or when overwriting this, you can pass a `repository` in
`options`.
The value of `repository` should be a URL to a GitHub repository, such as
`'https://github.com/user/project.git'`, or only `'user/project'`.

###### Mentions

By default, mentions are wrapped in `strong` nodes (that render to `<strong>` in
HTML), to simulate the look of mentions on GitHub.
However, this creates different HTML markup, as the GitHub site applies these
styles using CSS.
Pass `mentionStrong: false` to turn off this behavior.

## Security

Use of `remark-github` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast]).
It does inject links based on user content, but those links only go to GitHub.
There are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
