Contrary to the title, this song is definitely something special. Possibly the most underrated band to come out of Liverpool. Deffo one of my favourites, fuck the beatles with bells on.Â 

Jayne Cassey's vocals are so eccentric, unique and almost childlike (she also used to perform with a lampshade on her head, whilst the guitarist wore a kilt and the other members played in a camp and flamboyant manor). The bassist then went on to play in Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and the second drummer that joined the band was in The Slits and Siouxie and the Banshees. Ironically the band did not get big in Japan.

Scouse power at its finest xxxx
