Taken from [Wesqk Coast](https://wesqkcoast.bandcamp.com/)’s limited edition cassette \[OOH-011\] the video for 'S.T.A.S.H.'  
explores post-modern accelerationism with playful spirit taking advantage of the rhetorical  
aesthetics of computer gaming, pop-up financial info-graphics, commercial advertising and  
flash animations for social media.  
The naive scenarios set up with free stock footage found on-line create a surreal metaphor  
of the superficial omnivorous voracity governed today by control and exploitation.
