I'm stepping in for this feature, but thankfully it's easy, as I've literally just been introduced to an absolutely perfect sunday jam. It's from L U C Y, one of the untouchably brilliant DJ collective 6 Figure Gang (which alongside Jossy Mitsu, who contributed to our recent multi-writer article [Fantasy Realm](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/fantasy-realm), and Fauzia, one of our mass [R&S compilation](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/rs-records-in-order-to-care) review's standouts). I know that this track will stay on repeat for me, because it's got such a rare, perfect balance, soul and swing, it reminds me of MJ Cole's _Sincere_ in its pure amazingness.

Shout out to Loose Lips writer and ([sick](http://loose-lips.co.uk/mix-series)) DJ, CA$TLE, for introducing me to this, what he called his favourite UKG track of the decade. Which is a massive compliment, because let's be real, UKG is the best genre of the last 30 years. Phoebe Bridgers is the best singer, UKG is the best genre, Linda McCartney sausages are the best frozen product, it's just true.
