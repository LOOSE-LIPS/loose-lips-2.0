**Jamie Principle presents Raven, _It's My Pussy (Erotic Pussy Mix) (Freetown Inc)_**

A big inspiration to me and someone I'm happy to call a friend. This track is one out many in Jamie's back catalogue that ooze's sex. The Erotic Bleu mix is a perfect way to start seducing someone after a night out. Worked for me.

**Raze, _Break 4 Love (CBS Records)_**

Even though the lyrics to this track convey a message of love and affection, for me so much of the track screams lets get down and dirty. The drum loop is super sexy and the sample of the orgasmic woman is perfection and hot! The video is brilliant too.

Interesting fact for some of you out there, the woman's orgasm sample is actually taken from Lorna Patterson in the film _Airplane_, from a scene where she is actually crying.

**QX-1,** _**I Won't Hurt You (Rhythm Beat)**_

Ok so this is a song I wish I made. Mike Dunn under his QX-1 alias is fire. Its such a hypnotic beat which samples Kraftwerk's 'Home Computer' plus the sexy whispered vocals to get you off. Perfect if you're having sex high.

**Parris Mitchell,** _**Masturbation (Dance Mania)  
**_

You can guess from the title alone this track is pure filth. Parris Mitchell is a done when it comes to sleazy Chicago beats. Perfect for those dirty encounters or a 'bit of time' by yourself.

**Uncle Acid & The Deadbeats, _I'll Cut You Down (Rise Above)_**

This is a bit of a wild card track. With its dirty guitar, nod to old metal and driving beat, its bound to make you leave your inhibitions at the door.

**Stooges, _I Wanna Be Your Dog (Elektra)_**

Released in 1969 in the midst of the free love era.The repetition of the tracks famous riff is super seductive, a perfect rhythm to fuck too. And come on, Iggy Pop is someone most would like to fuck. Its no secret he comes well equipped.

**Massive Attack, _Metal Banshee (Mad Prof Mix) (Virgin Records)_**

This track is pure sleaze. Massive attack sampling Siouxsie & The Banshees'  remixed by Mad Professor, whats not to love? The primal tone of the beat can bring out anyone's inner banshee.

**Pyratronik, _Musica (Ka-Ka Version) (Ongoing)_**

For those moments when you've left the rave with someone you've been fighting sexual tension with for a while and you want to take it further, stick this on. 90's Italian techno at its best, slowed down to 127bpm even better. You wont want to stop, trust me.

**Susan, _I Only Come Out At Night (Epic)_**

Everything about this is hot. Brilliant production & nice vocals from Su. Great to seduce at any time, on repeat. I love that she's just simply called Susan too. Get it gurl.

**Josh Caffé, _One Night In Paris (International Gigolo Records)_**

Oh go on then, here's one of mine. This was written about an experience with someone in Paris years ago.That's all I'm going to say.
