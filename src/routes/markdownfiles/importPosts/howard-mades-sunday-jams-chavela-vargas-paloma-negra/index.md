I's sunday again, and I'm in my garden trying to play this on my guitar with a string missing and growling at my dog, trying to recreate her growl at 1.42 (god it's good). Might buy a bottle of tequila, not sure. 

This ranchera song has been covered by many but this version is my favourite, its originally sung by Lola Beltran but I heard this rendition first on “Frida”, a film about the life of Frida Kahlo, then a friend of mine put it on her story the other day and it inspired me to dig deeper into mexican music, made a decent playlist actually.
