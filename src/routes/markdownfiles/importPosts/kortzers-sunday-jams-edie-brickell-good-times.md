After a heavy night of Jungle last night its about time to wind down with something slightly more soothing. This week I've gone for a personal favourite, Edie Brickell â€“ Good Times. If this song doesn't sound like I don't know what does. The song features none other than Barry White, possible the most calming voice you could ever wish to hear. Wind down and let Edie & Barry float you into next week.
