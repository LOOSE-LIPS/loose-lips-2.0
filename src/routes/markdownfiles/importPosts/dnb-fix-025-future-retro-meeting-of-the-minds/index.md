![image](../../imported/dnb-fix-025-future-retro-meeting-of-the-minds/image1223.jpeg)_Future Retro, the latest new record label focused towards releasing 90’s inspired Jungle and Hardcore pulls up into the limelight this week with their debut 2 part vinyl / digital release; 'Meeting of The Minds'._ Cooked up from the infinitely amazing mind of Tim Reaper, Future Retro originally started out as a run of London based club nights however it has quickly evolved far beyond its humble beginnings. Now establishing itself as a potentially key label in the UK Jungle scene. Meeting of The Minds boasts a fierce ‘all-star’ collection of producers. Both volumes are comprised of 4 tracks each, all of which are collaborations from different artists working alongside Tim Reaper. Each track could easily merit it’s own feature, however I sadly can’t cover all of them in-depth otherwise we could be here until the end of summer.

The one track that stands out the most has to be ‘Losing Control' by World Wide Epidemic & Tim Reaper on Vol. 2. With it’s choppy metallic breaks that sound like they’ve been plucked straight off an early Photek track, Losing Control does a great job of building a weighty atmosphere while maintaining a sense of composure. Meeting of The Minds is available digitally on streaming sites now and a few wax copies of Vol.2 are still up for preorder via band camp. [https://soundcloud.com/futureretrolondon/sets/meeting-of-the-minds](https://soundcloud.com/futureretrolondon/sets/meeting-of-the-minds)
