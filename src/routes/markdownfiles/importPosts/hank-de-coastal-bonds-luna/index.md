Starting with an arp line slightly reminiscent of The Orb's _Little Fluffy Clouds_, _Coastal Bonds_ takes you in the same direction, carefully propelling you, eyes closed, above clouds..

From _SAVE THE NIGHT – GROOVE_ V/A EP on [Luna](https://lunaclub.com).

Out 16.10.2020 on 12" – [https://lunaclub.com](https://lunaclub.com/)

After almost 20 years of club business and countless nights of dancing under mirror balls, Luna Club, which is based in Kiel, brings together a selection of music from friends and family, to make up for the financial losses due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation. The whole compilation features songs from artists like Monkey Safari, Till von Sein and many more and it will be released in parts with 4-5 tracks on each output. Buy this compilation and literally "Save The Night", as well as one of the oldest institutions of Germany's club scene.
