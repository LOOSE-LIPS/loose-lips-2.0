![image](../../imported/death-grips-guillotine-omori-remix-index-tapes/image1243.jpeg)We've a special one for you, we've hit the 500th premiere mark and we wanted to make it very special.It came out as a natural way of saluting a close friend from one of our crew: Stoyan Yovchev AKA [Omori](https://soundcloud.com/stoyan-yovchev-omori) who sadly passed away this year, having left a rich legacy of music to stand time and act as a continuity of his presence.Omori's take on [Death Grips](http://thirdworlds.net/)' Bass/Hip-Hop mutant is a raw and dirty, grinding uptempo roller that brings new life to the 2011 original while adding his own touch of bass-heavy noiseness mixed with breakbeats.Â You can download it for free from our Soundcloud.From his dear friend and label-mate Jack Hunter, who's also our beloved Head of Comms here at LL:_"Stoyan was a great friend and extremely musically gifted. He's made lots of incredible music spanning many different genres, from lo-fi hip-hop, hip-hop, ambient, breakbeat and noise music. He touched, inspired and was admired by many. His music will always live on as a beacon of light of what is possible. There were never any boundaries, no boarders, no payments rejected. Rest in power, we are all at the mercy of your gift to this world_."Courtesy of [INDEX TAPES](https://soundcloud.com/indextapes).Our love goes to his family, his friends and everyone who have supported his music in one way or another.
