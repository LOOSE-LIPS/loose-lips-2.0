![image](../../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-gangsta-pat-i-wanna-smoke/image847.jpeg)This week is Memphis-inspired and comes from none other than Gangsta Pat! Gangsta Pat isn’t the first name that comes to mind when you think of a Sunday Jam but let me assure you they don’t get much better than this. Pat Hall hails from Memphis and gained notoriety mainly in the 90s, he's now 45. It’s worth noting that on his earlier albums Pat not only wrote the tracks but also played all the instruments, as well as producing them. Crack out your Swisher Sweets & settle down with Gangsta Pat for a serious Sunday Jam.
