_It’s time for another DnB Fix; and this time it comes in the form of something we’ve all been hoping for; “Rain” featuring over on cult.ure this A side banger from 45 Roller definitely hits the tone this week._

45 Roller is a new name on the block: but they are far from new to the industry.  45 Roller is one of Shy FX’s alias’ which is somewhat unsurprising given the exceptional level of production across both “Rain” and the B-Side “Outrun.”

Pulling me in with atmospheric thunder storms and pouring rain; something seemingly alien this week; is how we’re introduced to the plucking melody of the track; and then we hear our first glimpse of the alluring vocals of Anne Peebles; pulled from her 1974 classic “I can’t stand the rain” this coupled with a growing fanfare (a subtle nod to the original) is what really makes this tune.

This isn’t intricate, it doesn’t have mind-bending audio engineering; but what it lacks on that side of things is more than made up for by it’s charm and character; this is the song that would be slapping that smile on your face having crawled out of a sweaty tent; into the sun, full blown summer festival vibes.

Just to make it even better; you can get it on Bandcamp for free [NOW](https://shyfx.bandcamp.com/album/rain-outrun)!
