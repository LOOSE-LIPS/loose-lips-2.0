_International Drum & Bass trio Fractale make their mark on Unchained Recordings’ latest remix LP with a heavy hitting remix of HLZ’s half-time banger, Blind Slug._

CHina based label; Unchained Audio celebrates its diverse global network of incredible artists with a 16 track remix LP that showcases some of the best new tracks the label has to offer coupled with some seriously hot remixes from the back catalogue.

The LP is chock-a-block with weight from a selection of some of the best artists the scene has to offer, including Arkaik, Rohaan, Black Barrell, Whiney and Royalston. Many of these are well known household names in the European scene, but it’s not all about Europe, with the likes of China based Radiax and 3ASIC contributing fresh and unique productions on this VA.

[Loose Lips](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123 "Loose Lips") · [PREMIERE: HLZ – Blind Slug (Fractale Remix) (UNCH019)](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/premiere-hlz-blind-slug-fractale-remix-unch019 "PREMIERE: HLZ - Blind Slug (Fractale Remix) (UNCH019)")

Fractale’s gift to the remix LP is a 170bpm flip of HLZ’s track ‘Blind Slug’ – a heavyweight halftime track remixed into a gritty roller with tribal drums. The trio also have one of their own original productions on the release that sees Dutch Producer Subp Yao on the remix.

This year has seen Fractale back with a bang, with a release on Terra Firma (which is well worth checking out) amongst many hints that there is much more to look forwards to.

Unchained Recordings: The Remix LP is out tomorrow (Sept 11th); [click here to pre-order!](https://unchainedrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/unchained-the-remixes)
