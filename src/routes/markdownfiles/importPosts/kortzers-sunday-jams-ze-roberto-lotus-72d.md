This week I've chosen Ze Roberto â€“ 72D. In truth I know very little if anything about Roberto, and the lyrics go straight over my head, yet despite that this track powers through in terms of feeling & vibe. A feel good anthem despite not translating directly onto an English speaking ear, it's easy to soak in the sun kissed sounds. In all honesty this track could suit everyday of the week for me, but simply gives you a Sunday smile like no other. Close your eyes, imagine you're sat in the sunshine Pina Colada in hand, Happy Sunday!
