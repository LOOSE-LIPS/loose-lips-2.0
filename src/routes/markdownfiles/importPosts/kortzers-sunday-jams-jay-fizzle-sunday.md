I've chosen something abit different this week in the fashion of Jay Fizzle. This track came out yesterday if I'm correct and comes straight from Memphis! After spending some time in Memphis with Medallion Man earlier this year I came across quite a few new Hip Hop & Trap artists who are killing it in the city and continuing its long standing musical heritage. The tune is a real viber and is carried along by a poppin' head knockin' beat that makes you simply wanna get up and move. The albums out on Young Dolph's Paper Route Empire and is well worth a check!
