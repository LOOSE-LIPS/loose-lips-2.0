Anthemic Grime/Drill instrumental!

Perth based Grime/Drill merchant, Harvskyz creates a brutal soundscape of jagged aggressive drums and growling buzzsaw-like basslines with his debut EP, _Reality_. The release marks the first of many coming out this winter on the Edinburgh-Based, UK wide collective, SKOOP. Boasting vocal features from SAMA winning Glaswegian trap artiste [Kid Robotik](https://soundcloud.com/kid-robotik) along-side SKOOP's head honcho Tzusan and garnering praise in the past from the likes of Westy amongst others Harvskyz surely knows what he's doing.

From [Harvskyz](https://soundcloud.com/harvsykz)'s _Reality_ EP on [SKOOP](http://skoop.bandcamp.com).

Out now on digital â€“ [http://skoop.bandcamp.com](http://skoop.bandcamp.com)
