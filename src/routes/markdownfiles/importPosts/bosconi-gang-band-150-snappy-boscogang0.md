Manifattura Tabacchi is a former cigar and cigarette production site that is having a renaissance thanks to an innovative urban regeneration project. Back in June, the Bosconi Records crew rocked up there for a live hardware jam session featuring an array of musicians from the label including Fabio Della Torre on the mixer and Dukwa, Ennio Colaci, Herva, Mass Prod, Rufus, The Clover on the instruments with the special participation of A Guy Called Gerald. Now comes the record with the exceptional results all pressed to wax.  
The selected tracks follow the order of execution which has naturally developed in a crescendo from 130 to 180 BPM, and then closes by slowing down with a take at 110BPM.
