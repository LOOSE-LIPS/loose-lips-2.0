_Buckwild_ is hard to pin down; it's a stripped down number, that'd qualify as Dubstep but it's as if Minimal Techno had eaten a few edibles and its legs started wobbling while surrounding sounds drift in and out of focus.  
It's easy to get immersed into it and lose track of time, as you start paying attention to this warm feeling in your  
tummy that keeps pulsating.

From _Spheres of Sound: In Support of [Roshni](https://www.roshnibirmingham.org.uk/) and [UKBP](https://www.ukblackpride.org.uk/meet-the-team)_ V/A compilation on [Shifting Spheres](https://www.facebook.com/shiftingspheres).

Out 20.07.2020 on digital.

Known for holding DJ workshops across Manchester in collaboration with the likes of Limbo and Reform Radio, as well as running a podcast series dedicated to Manchester’s underground scene, Shifting Spheres have quickly built up rapport amongst a number of the city’s collectives including B.L.O.O.M, Not Bad For a Girl and All Hands on Deck.Now bringing together talent from across the UK, Shifting Spheres launch their label with the collaborative ‘Spheres of Sound: In Support of [Roshni](https://www.roshnibirmingham.org.uk/) and [UKBP](https://www.ukblackpride.org.uk/meet-the-team)’. 

The compilation highlights the creativity of womxn within the industry with artwork, sound engineering and production solely from non-binary and female talents: “We wanted to tackle an issue that has become heightened during COVID-19, domestic abuse. Roshni are an incredible Birmingham based organisation, empowering BAME women to escape gender-related violence. UK Black Pride fight for LGBTQ people of colour, through community outreach and hardship funds. UKBP are a crucial organisation that align with our belief system, hence why we chose to support them."
