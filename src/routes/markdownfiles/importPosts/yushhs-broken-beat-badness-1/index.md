**Ahead of her set at Loose Lips’ 5th anniversary night in Bristol, we asked local donnie Yushh to share some of the lush, hater-hushing sonic badassery that characterises her sets. The Pressure Dome labelhead did not disappoint, sharing a slew of ‘Broken beat badddnessss’ (yes we corrected the spelling, we’re sorry.) Enjoy!**

**Tom Blip & Swordman Kitala – Kitala Beat**

One of my fave releases this year so far, such a good tune for switching up the vibe. Weighty vocals, bass driven beat, UK – Uganda connect, can’t go wrong. 

**&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&#8221;http://blipdiscs.bandcamp.com/album/kitala-beat-blip008&#8243;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Kitala Beat (BLIP008) by Tom Blip &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Swordman Kitala&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;**

**BFTT – I**

Taken from BFTT’s latest release on Gobstopper records, all three tracks on the release are high quality. Such a talented DJ / producer – was lucky enough to have him come down and play at the label launch for Pressure Dome. Safe to say, he smashed it.  

**E-Unity – 3.6** 

Could have chosen a number of E-Unity tracks, love this guy’s production. Very individual style, very fun to mix, nice amount of space to blend over other tracks. This one maybe the more overlooked B side of the Tallarita EP from last year. 

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&#8221;http://ftdrecords.bandcamp.com/album/e-unity-tallarita-ep-ftd009&#8243;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;E-Unity ~ Tallarita EP ~ FTD009 by E-Unity&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

**Caldera – Don't Ask Me Why**

This came on while flicking through soundcloud and when I first heard it I just loved how west the arrangement of the track is – constantly trying to trick you. Once I had it on the USB realized how fun it was to mix and give that juxta position. WNCL has put out a lot of good stuff over the last few years. 

**Deadboy – Deemz**  

Straight banger, will continue to rinse for a while.

**Via Marris – Side Effects**

Patina Echoes is such a great release from Timedance but think this track is my fave. Beautiful stuff that translates really well in the club.

**Henry Greenleaf – The Way** 

Such a talented producer and all round lovely guy. This one draws on a whole host of influences, techno, electro, breaks, garage – Par Avion are doing good bits.

**DJ Haram – Grace (K.O.D)**

Middle eastern vibes with a huge sub and wicked percussion. Haven’t had chance to play this one out yet but pretty sure it’s going to bang.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&#8221;http://djharam.bandcamp.com/album/grace&#8221;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Grace by dj haram&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
