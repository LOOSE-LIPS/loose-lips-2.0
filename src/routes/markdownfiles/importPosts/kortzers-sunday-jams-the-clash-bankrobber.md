This week I've chosen an all time favourite, The Clash's _Bankrobber_. The track combines many different styles and influences. Featuring wobbly synth lines backed by a ska rhythm, blended in with dubby processing whilst being topped with a raspy punk ballard. The track was recorded in 1980 & was produced by legendary Mikey Dread. The preachy tale drifts you off into trip daydream, all the while being soothed by the reggae rhythm and dubby backbeat. Proper Sunday Jam.
