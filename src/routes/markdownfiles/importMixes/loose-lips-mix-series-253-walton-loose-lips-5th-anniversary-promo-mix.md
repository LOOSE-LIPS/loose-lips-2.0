In anticipation of our Secret Location Rave: Keysound x Loose Lips we have bass heavyweight Walton in the mix for our 253rd installment.

Being one of the driving forces that helped shape the bass scene in the early 2010s, with releases on Tectonic, Hyperdub and Illian Tape, he’s coming with half an hour of unrelenting, skull splitting, gut wrenching bass injections that will get you warmed up for his b2b set alongside Logos for our 5 year anniversary party on the 29th of November happening in a secret location in East London.
