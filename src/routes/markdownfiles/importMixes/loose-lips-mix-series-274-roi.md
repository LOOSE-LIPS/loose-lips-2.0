3 weeks ago, we introduced one co-founder of A’Coruna’s Fanzine Records to our Mix Series, and now it’s time for the other partner in crime to join the fun…

A high voltage Electro hour delivered by Roi, bringing back memories of an incredible trance-inducing set he played at their festival’s after-party in Galicia last December!

@roi-fanzine

The introverted personality of Roi could be considered as atypical within the clubbing scene. He lives apart from the madding crowd, instead surrounded by nature nearby the sea – his source of inspiration which wllows him to focus completely on music production.

Roi is a tireless promoter of club culture in the North West of Spain and an active part of the projects Fanzine and Cudbe. Well known for his rhythmic and well-outlined DJ sets, hs mixes range from deep house and dub, through to embracing a powerful Techno sound; Roi moves like a fish in water.

Be prepared.
