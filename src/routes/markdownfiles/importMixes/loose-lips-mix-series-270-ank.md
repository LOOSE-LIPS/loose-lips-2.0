A sick new entry! Our 270th mix, nicknamed COVID-270, is from Ank, who co-runs OLAM in Bratislava. We met him back in January when he hosted the Slovakian leg of our 5th Anniversary tour, with @medallionman, @auderkortzer, @jef-t-scale and @cultivated-electronics!

Lukas Ostrolucky aka DJ ANK has been working in the electronic music industry for more than 20 years, as a DJ and also as an event manager and promoter (through OLAM, Asfalt Soundsystem and the Derivate warehouse project).

He is the creator and seeker of an atmospheric and vivid soundscapes. Enigmatic sets are his trademark, craftily build from two decades of clubbing. Ank is here to cut through the darkness via a combination of minimalism and complexity.
