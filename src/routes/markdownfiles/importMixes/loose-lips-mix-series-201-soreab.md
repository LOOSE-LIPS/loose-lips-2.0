Soreab is the musical project of Dario Picchi. Native from Tuscany (Italy), but resident in London, in his main moniker Dario is able to melt different musical influences picked up during his 6 years residency in the City, carving a name out for himself with his intertextual productions referencing Uk bass, Grime, Dubstep, Tribal and Rave with his personal background, formed listening Dance, Progressive, House and Techno.

His unique sound, based on arpeggios, 80’s synths, melodic breaks, rhythms melted with fx and boomy subs in main cycles, everything mixed in a dark, emotive Techno and bass atmosphere, has just been noticed by some of the major selectors and tastemakers around, with airplays on the biggest UK radios like NTS, Rinse FM, Reform Radio, 10Twenty and Noods Radio. He’s currently a 199radio resident dj, hosting his own show every last Friday of the month, and he used to drop his crew parties at The Alibi in Dalston.
