After having the Loose Lips Mix Series on their hit list for quite some time, Hanz & Sonice collaborate on a mix that sums up their styles in 120 minutes of heat.

Lock into Hanz & Sonice’s eclectic styles – the pair have been playing together and individually, for the past 4 years throughout Manchester and beyond, as part of the Strange Riddims Crew. As solo acts they both search far and wide incorporating genres from all over the globe…together they’re a force to be reckoned with!
