YES SELECTOR!

https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/mikeysibson

Leeds-born, London-based DJ, producer and record collector Mikey Sibson has been involved with playing records since the age of 15, constantly refining his tastes and skills to present music in fresh new lights and push the boundaries of what might be possible in a club.  
Sibson combines jazz, funk and rock & roll sensibilities with a flair for blissed-out global frequencies. When he is not overseeing the selectors series at his electronic music website, 45turns.com, you might find Mikey showcasing rare vinyl cuts alongside guests and diggers from London’s thriving world music scene at his own Elevator East club night.

At 22, he has DJ’d in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Croatia, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam and all over Italy, as well as holding up residencies at 2000-capacity clubnights in his native Leeds. Sibson has also shared the booth at festivals with the likes of Daniele Baldelli, Nick The Record and balearic legends such as Leo Mas and Phil Mison. His own productions range from the balearic rock & roll chaos of The Alloways to the eclectic, dancefloor ready Elevator Edits imprint, yet a common thread runs through all of Sibson’s work: a desire to challenge the norm, discover new sounds and create unique musical moments wherever he goes.
