We today welcome to our mix series…Noods radio resident, and core WXMB 2 member, NIKS.

@niksdelanancy

NIKS, South-East London born, and South-West England bred, has produced a mix full of jungle, techno, hardcore and beautiful rave! She describes these genres as “the themes to her childhood” – genres which her brother brought her up on with cassette tapes and records from the early jungle days. This succinct, sharp and hard hitting 140+ BPM mix focuses on music of these styles, produced by artists of the current day – artists who NIKS feels are keeping the 90s inspirations alive!
