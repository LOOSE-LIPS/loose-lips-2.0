@natashagiordano

Natasha Giordano is a London based, Italian-born multi-instrumentalist. Her music is an experimental ambient journey through her inner places and emotions, often resulting in dark and dreamy soundscapes, sweet melodies, analogue drones and hypnotic vocal loops.

Find all her releases here – https://natashagiordano.bandcamp.com

Past live performances – https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/natashagiordano/dates

Her last release ‘Trilogy of Disjunction’, is out now on Inside Out Records (London) – an emotive collection of three ambient drone tracks composed with a minimal combination of analog synthesisers, classical violin recordings and haunting vocals that describe the emotional state of choice under uncertainty.

Natasha also hosts a monthly radio show, Mirror Sounds, on @threadsradio – where she likes to investigates new ambient/experimental sounds and plenty of incredible techno.

And if that weren’t enough, Natasha has recently started a new collaboration named ‘Same Sky’ that features ambient lightwaves, experimental soundscapes and reverberated echoed clouds composed by herself and Filip Sijanec. Same Sky has recently released this live mix for Threads…

…and will release a series of album experiments on Bandcamp starting this summer.

Delve deeper and check Natasha out!
