90 minutes of pumping electro, techno and ravey madness from the man who’ll be playing alongside, and has invited, @medallionman & @kortzer for our Loose Lips showcase gig in Hamilton, Canada in May!

@trevor-wilkes

Trevor is a legend, renowned for being an incredibly unique DJ, slamming tunes together in no-nonsense fashion.

Make sure to check out the live streams he hosts – every Friday @ Noon EST (-5 GMT) @ www.facebook.com/FitMBleepRadio.

“I live in Canada (Hamilton, Ontario), but all the music I like and the people associated with it are far away. Everything I do is an attempt to make the world a smaller place for like minded people.”
