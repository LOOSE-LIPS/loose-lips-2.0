Prince Of Deptford, usually hiding his royal identity under a civil name Daniel Cherney, is a DJ, producer and musician with eastern European roots, currently based in Berlin. Check out his releases on London based Squareglass, the German label Sonic Moire, and his own imprint Unsustainable.

Having also done band releases all over Europe, he’s recently joined a zombie disco live act collective, Wax Museum. Their debut is coming out on Unsustainable on the 1st of June 2020.

Prince Of Deptford also invests his energy into running Happy Endings parties in London and Berlin, producing club tracks, and hosting regular shows on Threads. If you’re ever in London a Thursday when Happy Endings is popping off at Dalston Superstore, make sure to head on down for some raucous fun.

This includes a number of unreleased tunes by Prince Of Deptford and fellow producers…namely DJ Mantis, Unfolded Memories and last but not least. Withheld – Withheld’s new EP is out on Unsustainable next week, with a Loose Lips premiere lined up!
