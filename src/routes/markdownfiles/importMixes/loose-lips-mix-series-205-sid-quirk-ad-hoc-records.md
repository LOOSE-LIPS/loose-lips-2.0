The first mix Sid Quirk has released aside from hia residency on Limbo Radio in about a year. Showcasing the development of his tastes in the last year, the mix only includes records that he bought within that time period. Challenging himself, spending months planing it… whilst there are some brand new records in there, he has not tied himself to only playing brand new or unreleased music. It was recorded at home in Chorlton, Manchester on a Friday afternoon 2 x 1200’s and an XDJ-RX.
