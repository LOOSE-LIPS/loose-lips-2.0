Brooding broken beats throughout…

Holy Island, an island off of the coast of North Wales is where Dez Williams begun spinning wax at an early age and now maintains his humble analogue / digital studio. Isolated from the marketing, fashion and pretentious attitudes that plague the music industry, Dez is free to express himself through his machines. Safe from this environment he is unconstrained and has no urge to conform with any ideal or aesthetic. A window into his soul. His day job at an electronic components factory means that he is no stranger to repetition, rhythm and electronics. His sound is perhaps a product of his daily grind of boredom & escapism, combined with a long term passion for technology, horror and science fiction.

Inspired by many of the classic Chicago / Detroit / electro / techno producers, like the finest, his sound is unique, uncompromising and unpredictable. His vision of techno is deep and futuristic with a heavy dose of funk. Dez’s passion for sound and the darker side of the human spirit compels him to create tracks on an almost daily basis and he sits on an incredibly vast archive of cassettes, mini-discs and CD’s of his work. Yet his reclusive nature dictates that his release schedule remains sparse. His tracks can range from driving techno, to melancholy and dark synthesizer orchestrations, ghostly deep listening, straight up electro cuts and beyond.

Williams’ tracks have found their way into the sets of DJs like Dave Clarke, Andrea Parker, Adam X, John Peel, Ellen Allien, Mike Dred and Rob Hall.

He has constantly retained an underground / cult fanbase. His debut LP ‘Elektronik Religion’ for the SCSI label was hailed as “one of the very few truly great electro albums of the new century”. Dez remains true to the underground and simply creates for the love and need to do so. The mark of a true artist. He continues to DJ and play live sets worldwide and has had releases on a variety of record labels including Bedouin, Earwiggle, Trust, Minimal Soul, Warmdata, Acruacree, Ai, Cheap,SCSI-AV, Blase, Voodoo, and Ben Sims’ Native imprint.
