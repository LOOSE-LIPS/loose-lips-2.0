Green Bay Wax is a label & collective uncompromisingly putting out exclusively 90s style Jungle, Drum & Bass & Hardcore. Whilst keeping the tunes fresh, they have the strictest focus towards that "golden era" sound and a passion for the movement it brought with it. All Junglist & Junglettes Hold Tight!

Since their inception in October 2014, the pair have enjoyed a host of digital and vinyl releases, with positive reviews from the likes of Mixmag, Trusik and Duploc, alongside completing a round of European festivals and a debut US tour in 2017. Bassweight is the name of the game with these guys.
