To wave goodbye to summer, we're raising funds and spreading the awareness of Headway East London, a charity supporting people affected by brain injury. Working across 13 London boroughs, they offer specialist support and services for over 200 survivors, family, friends and carers in the local area each week.They also brilliantly promote awareness and understanding of brain injury in their mission to build a world with survivors who are valued, respected and able to live fulfilling lives.[](http://headwayeastlondon.org/?fbclid=IwAR0zjWxxDZtVvg7jM3y0hqtIZ1tTqit4NriPfIdOeAe3cG6gFVcf45ow1z4)[http://headwayeastlondon.org](http://headwayeastlondon.org)[](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Floose-lips.co.uk%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR10cujH1MPte5XAK0SwfzOBlbYJqXNFyAKUntPb25Dq_VHPkFBbj7vihu8&h=AT2cJg-VrccKD-IO5XeKmWIaGuZfyW-GRQmjRFw__TqlM2HAD_EVWvn0xZnvpapTYE7025DsdKqvZghWl0myE9OXol9CdpRjK0DbgSkA8z_hifxcrzVKfeGkd5fr6tSW61XnJkg)[http://loose-lips.co.uk](http://loose-lips.co.uk)Headway East London's efforts still really need their word spreading…and so come on down to the wonderfully green Grow Tottenham venue, on Sat 21st Sep, for an eclectic 8 hour, 2 room event. Look forward to some amazing exhibitions, live musical performances ranging from distorted UK Hip Hop through to uplifting jazz, and a host of oddball DJs!

artsclub will also be curating an art exhibition entitled ‘Square Format: A Celebration of Art Contributions to Modern Day Club Culture’. It aims to immortalise contemporary rave art that has only existed in the digital sphere. In today’s scene, social media provides the space for the promotion of events and is the platform for the artwork that represents them. Once the event is over, an artist’s work is lost to the recesses of the internet; existing in the void, searchable but not present.  The exhibition will celebrate this art by enlarging, printing and projecting it on the walls of Grow Tottenham. This allows the work to be appreciated in the same light as the physical rave art of old, enhancing one's perception and appreciation of it. The works will be available to buy through an auction on the day, with all profits going to Headway East London. They will be printed at 50cm x 50cm and framed.——14:00 – 22:00£5 minimum donation taken in aid of Headway East London on entrance.——
