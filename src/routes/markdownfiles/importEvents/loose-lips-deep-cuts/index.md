Our first in-person LL event since the start of lockdown!! So excited to be back üôÇLoose Lips‚Äô Deep Cuts aims to share the diverse ways we experience music. Starting life as a monthly editorial feature with writers, DJs and artists responding to a shared theme, on September 13th we will be bringing that expressive energy to the Cause‚Äôs high definition speakers. Best believe we were planning this pre-COVID.Expect explorative sets from an amazing variety of DJs and vocalists with their own indistinguishable vibe. Each set will take on a particular theme, a theme that will be reflected live by a visual artist, creating that set‚Äôs cover art on the spot.All sets will go out live on The Cause‚Äôs native Threads Radio and be uploaded for re-listening, so don‚Äôt worry if Shazam lets you down!All the profits from the event ‚Äì and from the artworks‚Äô sale ‚Äì will go towards Ruff Sqwad Arts Foundation, a charity that helps young people discover their own potential in creative careers and life, using music sessions and partnerships to aid expression ‚Äì [](https://www.ruffsqwadarts.org/about?fbclid=IwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0)[https://www.ruffsqwadarts.org/about](https://www.ruffsqwadarts.org/about). This follows on from our recent 2-volume compilation album which was released in aid of them as well ‚Äì¬†[](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flooselips123.bandcamp.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0&h=AT17NdpSKZFjnwSF-rReE7gLHBac6J8p9XnXxeBZx3Qwp8o7vuUKS3d7imJaAxMU9ALLH8KQI6DjeSz2nqwELZzFG0bbovUW_8D4ubqqL7IO_YknmJY2-jdWEthJOE3YmY-9-qA)[https://looselips123.bandcamp.com](https://looselips123.bandcamp.com)!‚ÄîLINE-UP:Our headliner is an essential cult figure ‚Äì and definitely not an EDM producer ‚Äì MarshmeLLo. The House & Soul aficionado and NTS radio resident whose ‚ÄòMidnight Marauders‚Äô show was the first to be broadcast on the station, we knew she had to play at the first socially distanced Loose Lips event, after reflecting on the sheer hypnosis she pulled off at a Josey Rebelle-curated Pickle Factory night last year.¬†Her set‚Äôs theme will be ‚ÄúMidnight Marauders of the Future‚Äù.Closing out the day will be Don Sinini, a DJ, producer and singer whose unique take on Dancehall balances London charisma and melodic warmth, though his tastes stretch far and wide. (We had the honour of giving him his first official interview back in 2018, check it out;¬†[](https://bit.ly/2QpQ7wb?fbclid=IwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0)[https://bit.ly/2QpQ7wb](https://bit.ly/2QpQ7wb)).¬†Theme: ‚ÄúWaves‚ÄùPresenting a very different but similarly breezy sound will be Rosy Ross, a senior producer and resident DJ at Threads radio, whose shows consistently serve a unique combination of wily grooves and faded glam, inspired by her seaside town youth.¬†Theme: ‚ÄúEn Vacances‚ÄùAnother totally different but toootally rad selector is Ifeoluwa, whose last Corsica Studios set displayed the DJ‚Äôs characteristic high energy fire, ranging from Footwork to Britney Spears. Since Ifeoluwa‚Äôs passions stretch across the bpm range, (as demonstrated by their contribution ¬†to the last Deep Cuts article alongside Don Sinini: [](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F34xI3ld%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0&h=AT0gwFB8UKfTHBvsnAm50Kxe_NxVi25YoVWQ4KSc6ZAWgSKrOzvfncCzkje9HJgZfoan5EHcaOS_sIUuFN6XoInL0FGYzL3E9tSywVKb1icQ4d-9knK6_e12bFVWONThtxN0IWo)[https://bit.ly/34xI3ld](https://bit.ly/34xI3ld)) they will be packing a totally different breed of banger.¬†Theme: ‚ÄúSunset‚ÄùThen there is Tem, a rising DJ, promoter and 1020 Radio host whose show ‚ÄòFreedom of Groovement‚Äô takes a 2 hour dive into a different country each month, with his Bristol-based night of the same name highlighting under-appreciated international DJs and bangers. You can only say this so many times in one event description, but this guy has a s e r i o u s collection of sonic gems.¬†Theme: ‚ÄúNo Borders‚ÄùIt wouldn‚Äôt be a Loose Lips event with appearance from our resident DJ roster, melting minds everywhere from Manchester to Macedonia since 2014. LL founder and bossman himself Medallion Man will be opening proceedings with a swirl of psychedelia ‚Äì theme: ‚ÄúEnter The Trip‚Äù ‚Äì before Felix Raman guides us into the eye of the storm with his ‚ÄúDystopia Dub‚Äù set.And last but not least (actually neither, he‚Äôll be playing in the middle of the day) is Will Soer, Loose Lips editor and proud mama of Deep Cuts. Soer will be exploring the transcendent vibes from his Threads Radio show ‚ÄòOut Of Body Pop‚Äô, with help from next-gen vocal badass and Deep Cuts writer Julia Star (who chose this month‚Äôs Deep Cuts article title: DEAD INSIDE BUT IT‚ÄôS OK), check out her new music video here: [](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2R54aHL%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0&h=AT077m524HTwFjDLPhygfvcJ1TbRsDbMHbqYcSVlwg1zsrjOAUKg5RPiCyvQfSlJJOyQXsyKMGim6SdzmMKbyBmH62Kf5fdzQLKF--ShANfJbFPuFEjWp1b137_hlzncDaBLL9o)[https://bit.ly/2R54aHL](https://bit.ly/2R54aHL)Theme: ‚ÄúOut Of Body Airlines‚Äù‚ÄîArtwork by the majestic Trav as ever, check his website here:¬†[](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2G0aPkr%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0&h=AT1ng9yIripmdooQHL5p37JDtXt39gsbIKHOyR6Ni7Ft27zH6xtI-x4Jjw4nIG4V7Oi3B3pdhXGCU5tjk1pkSOqflZycYcSj7SC0R0XqCNYEgrhxV9CjRqFEyk2giuIq3OFkMfk)[https://bit.ly/2G0aPkr](https://bit.ly/2G0aPkr).‚ÄîTICKETS ‚Äì [](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcosta-del-tottenham.eventcube.io%2Fevents%2F26071%2Floose-lips-deep-cuts-in-the-yard-at-costa-del-tottenham-southside%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0&h=AT1ts-uM8GTQX149Pk1vLDI6eNOztKBawLm1JMfXtHQTUuzTpoawg2BhjpP7I3lIbOQGJjSbmvw_dAjcBHaMrri3kiptlqfic994dA6Nu8vAcZwJl6InxLkHjPXwIFAELWHqmow)[https://costa-del-tottenham.eventcube.io/events/26071/loose-lips-deep-cuts-in-the-yard-at-costa-del-tottenham-southside](https://costa-del-tottenham.eventcube.io/events/26071/loose-lips-deep-cuts-in-the-yard-at-costa-del-tottenham-southside)‚ÄîStreet food: People's burgerDrinks: Pint sized cocktails, frozen margaritas, Pirate's Grog Rum, craft beer & moreCosta Del TottenhamThe Yard,¬†[#Southside](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/southside?__eep__=6) at The Cause\*\*\*BOOKING INFO\*\*\*In line with current COVID rules all bookings will be designated with a set table/area in groups of 6 or 8 people for your social bubbles.The cover for this is ¬£10 per head assuming your table is full and includes entry, a welcome cocktail if you arrive on time (¬£8 value), your reserved space, DJ and access to our various bars and a food trader.Please aim to arrive at the beginning of your booked session.[supportthecause.co.uk](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupportthecause.co.uk%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Orajd8NWDG1w9-_PsgLWWemzGBo24bO4ljtCmxxjdNNcC4RZPTumL4D0&h=AT1_aEpgiytKlY2jVMkvUm9kkVNak2N1XmxHq26gx17viKq6S5ZFpqUV3TpTTNwGF8NzRhp78pvHDnDTK5WNxu4r4GyDWC_QnH46GxDgq_Sfkyo4J6UgJOMBeVIvJ7doIPlc0mw)
