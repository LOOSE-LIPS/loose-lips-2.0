HEAD OF WEBSITE AND CONTENT MANAGEMENT / PREMIERE MANAGER / RESIDENT DJ / WEIRDO25 years ago, a Belgian teenager fired up FastTracker II on his parents PC. A black page populated by row upon row of white letters and jade numbers appeared, with columns for ‘note’, ‘octave’, ‘instrument’ and ‘effect’. Ever since then, the self-described official weirdo known as T-Scale has been pulling colour out of darkness; designing, structuring and curating sounds that roam from analogue origins to fantastic lands. He has released a wide variety of music on labels such as Dionysian Mysteries, Electric Bacon Records, Strict Tempo, and his own co-founded Faster Than Music, whilst maintaining a touring schedule that spans Europe. The label, crew and event series through which T-Scale has exerted influence on the scene is Loose Lips, an international collective who share his dedication to exploring the enormous variety of underground dance music (a few of his current favourite artists – Tropical Interface, Gem Tree and HERBARIUM – come from the international Eco Grime scene). His recent mix ([Loose Lips Mix Series – 270 – T-Scale](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/loose-lips-mix-series-269-t-scale)) comes with a willfully ambiguous ‘Feral Bass’ genre tag, and was shared by LL Bossman Frederick Sugden with the following words: ‘A Loose Lips mix from probably the best DJ I know, someone who has completely inspired me since the beginning of our friendship, and someone who is at the centre of the [Loose Lips](https://www.facebook.com/LooseLips123/?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARCn6Ca4XHHC52IP5_c-5Nm-88AquGWBE370LkeXh9Qrc2GWO8cwYAf25yeK0ytIzLkDBchp90fHaJ0J&fref=mentions) spirit.’This collaboration was originally sparked in the smoking area of North London’s Silver Bullet, before T-Scale began co-organising nights, forming bonds, and developing their unique identity. To understand this identity, one need look no further than the weekly premieres he has organised since 2017. Though much of it is grounded in nightclubs, this is absolutely not a series of DJ tools and House tracks; each premiere stands on its own feet as a listening experience, showcasing an astounding variety of identity and style.Dedication to finding new expressive corners and channels of electronic music is also demonstrated in T-Scale’s extra curricular activities; he recently wrapped up 6 months of work with Kronom and ogie on score for the German 1920s silent film Morn To Midnight. An expressionist critique of greed and materialism that used hallucinatory visuals and fantastic makeup to outline emotional drama, it makes perfect sense that T-Scale lends his hands to this work, as – despite its unique power – it originally went totally under the radar, finding little success outside of Japan. His current project, Dialogue, is funded by the Macedonian Ministry of Culture, and involves motion capture applied to audio, in order to meld the expressions of ballet dancer Ivana Kocevska and pianist Dino Imeri, alongside producer Kronom.
