RESIDENT DJ As a recent emerging artist, Rommek has shown promising developments in his own sound, as well as carving his way into the current techno scene.His extensive interest in sound design is embedded within the atmospheric, dark and textured tracks he produces.His debut, 'Thought Patterns EP' on the London based label Weekend Circuit, established his position on the map.Since then, various releases and Dj sets have proven his wide appeal through the combination of the energetic, gritty UK sound combined with deep and transcendental aspects.In 2016 Rommek joined the iconic Blueprint Records, with his ‘Moth Hole’ EP and also contributed to the 20 years ‘Structures and Solutions’ compilation.Through these releases he has gained support from the likes of Rødhad, Ben Sims, Inigo Kennedy, Shifted, Luke Slater, The Black Dog and many more.
