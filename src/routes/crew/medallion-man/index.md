FOUNDER / INTERVIEWER / RESIDENT DJMedallion Man is co-founder, resident, and the driving force behind Loose Lips. Since its launch in October 2014, he has directed its growth into a well-respected and ever-ambitious diverse musical platform, co-curating events, label releases, charity work, mix series, radio shows and the blog's activities. His own DJing continues to blossom alongside the wider project, seeing him regularly DJ around the UK & Europe, gaining a reputation for intriguing mixing across a maze of tempos and genres.He also works as head of publishing at the established label, [2020Vision Recordings](https://soundcloud.com/2020visionrecordings), and runs a mysterious new vinyl label called [Reposition](https://soundcloud.com/repositionrecords), alongside Third Ear's El Prevost. He also carefully manages a diverse roster of musicians, ranging from unique singer-songwriters through to modular geeks.He started playing on the radio, developing a unique take on experimental and electronic music. Animating several shows on different stations during the last years, he regularly offers listeners 2 hours of varied sounds. In April 2017, this passion extended to starting his own station, a brand new community project called [Threads Radio](http://www.threadsradio.com) which has quickly grown into a thriving and internationally recognised project. His own Loose Lips show is every Monday night, 8-10pm, and invites artists for guest mixes and interviews on a weekly basis – [http://loose-lips.co.uk/radio-shows](http://loose-lips.co.uk/radio-shows).If this wasn't all enough, he's also co-director of '[London Promoters' Society](https://www.facebook.com/londonpromotersociety/)', alongside Hayley Squires, a project which aims to bring more cohesion and collective spirit into London's diverse musical melting pot of event promoters.Finally, make sure to check out Triple M, a new romantic duo he's part of – [https://www.soundcloud.com/triplemduo.](https://www.soundcloud.com/triplemduo.)_Some mixes (check out more on_ [_soundcloud_](http://www.soundcloud.com/medallionman)_):_
