CREATIVE EDITOR / WRITERWill Soer's [work](http://outofbodypop.wordpress.com) – which includes in-depth interviews, gonzo reviews and a monthly 2 hour radio show – focusses on intimate, expressive music (or 'out of body pop' as he calls it), alongside the subjective experiences and identities it evokes.Over the last 2 years he has developed a collaborative project named Deep Cuts, aiming to explore the real voices of music experience in our generation, to explore the human possibilities of expressive music journalism. He also edits Loose Lips' weekly Sunday Jams and Picks features, writing the latter's introductions.His work previously specialised in dance music (a genre with plenty of [crossover with oobp](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/picks-will-soers-liminal-state-dance-records)), the analysis of which has manifested itself in a 50 page Social Anthropology masters [dissertation](https://www.academia.edu/34746084/Utopia_On_Wax_The_Meaningful_Functionality_of_Synthetic_Dance_Music) and a 32-page magazine reframing the paper's points through his experiences living, dancing, and studying in Edinburgh.
