Anyone even remotely familiar with the world of records and vinyl will be aware of Soho’s leading wax supplier, Phonica Records. While the store holds a temple-like status amongst vinyl fiends, the shop is also responsible for providing a platform to some of the most prominent artists in electronic music, including Palms Trax, Heidi, Anthea and Hector to name a few. With a slew of prolific artists starting their careers in the retail of records, Phonica’s latest export, Luther Vine, is set to the carry the torch all the way, with his deep underlying passion for music and people.

Having spent his early years studying in Manchester’s acclaimed Chetham’s School of Music, Luther Vine made the move to London to bolster his evolving passion in the underground dance music scene. Luther, whilst not personally digging records for the likes of Pete Tong, Floating Points, Jamie Jones, Enzo Siragusa and Skream, plays at Egg LDN as part of his residency alongside Kyle E, a residency that has seen him play alongside some of the industry’s greats, including Omar S, Andrew Weatherall, Artwork and Voigtmann.

Luther joined the Loose Lips show for a discussion and dig through some of his favourite memories, influences and tunes.

First hour hosted by @medallionman.
