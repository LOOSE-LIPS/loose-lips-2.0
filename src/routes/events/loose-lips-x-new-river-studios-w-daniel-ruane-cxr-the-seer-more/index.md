LINE-UP:

– Daniel Ruane (Infinite Machine) – LONDON DEBUT[](https://soundcloud.com/daniel-ruane-2)[https://soundcloud.com/daniel-ruane-2](https://soundcloud.com/daniel-ruane-2)

Manchester’s Daniel Ruane is one of the leading lights to emerge out of the worldwide experimental club landscape.

Riddled with rhythms that twist to escape from conventional beat and dance forms, the 24 year old’s universe is generated of ethereal textures heavily instructed by sci-fi concepts, video game music and pitch black soundtracks. Daniel creates whimsical, enigmatic narratives that reject and evade the ideas of club friendly and the dancefloor being the terminus of this concept driven medium.

Ruane’s hard-hitting and unconventional releases have found a home on Infinite Machine (CA/MEX), Natural Sciences (UK), Hyperboloid Records (RUS), Proximal Records (US), Schematic (US), The Silent Howl (CA) and oqko (DE) among others. His music has been championed by early supporters which include Objekt, Samuel Kerridge, Minor Science and Dis Fig and he’s received enthusiastic press support from the likes of Resident Advisor, Mixmag, Clash, Trax Mag, Groove, The Brvtalist, XLR8R, Ransom Note and The Skinny.

– Medallion Man (199Radio/Loose Lips)[](https://www.facebook.com/medallionmanmusic)[https://www.facebook.com/medallionmanmusic](https://www.facebook.com/medallionmanmusic)
