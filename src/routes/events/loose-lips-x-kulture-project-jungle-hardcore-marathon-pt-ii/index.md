HARDCORE WILL NEVER DIE.  
After a very successful collaboration back in December at Stage & Radio, Loose Lips and The Kulture Drum & Bass Project are back with the breaks but this time were making our mark at Indigo Withington.  
For our last event we had the pleasure of hosting the likes of Greenbay Wax (Kid Lib & Percussive P), Six Sunsets, Luke Leadbelly, Sl8r, Impurity and more. This time we're keeping it a more family affair and have a selection of residents and pals coming down to supply the vibes.  
We will also be taking over Limbo Radio on 19th May for a 4 hour warm up 5 days before the event so be sure to lock in to that!  
EVENT DETAILS:Times: 22:00-02:00Tickets: £2-£4 Online (More OTD)Location: 455 Wilmslow Rd, Withington, Manchester, M20 4AN  
LINEUP:  
\ CLUBFOOT \[Strange Riddims\] The brainchild behind the Strange Riddims ensemble, Clubfoot started the collective with a group of like-minded South Manchester based artists which now includes the like of Anz, Sonice, Afrodeutsche, Henzo and more. The group formed on the basis that there was a lack of people pushing the more obscure sounds in the scene and every time Clubfoot hits the decks you can hear this in his selections.   
\ KORZI \[Limbo Radio\] Limbo resident DJ and one of the driving forces behind the Limbo Radio operation as a whole, Korzi is a versatile DJ/Producer that fucks with any genre at any speed. It is impossible to put this guy's style in a box and this is something he prides himself on. We're very excited to see what he has in store for us on the night.  
\ MARACUYA \[B L O O M // Not Bad For A Girl\] Maracuya wows crowds at events all the way from B.L.O.O.M. residents parties to illegal raves. Her free party-influenced frenetic sets always get the crowd pumping, with anything from breaksy electro to 170bpm old school Jungle.  
Typically a purveyor off all things fast and bassy, Kulture Project resident and head honcho Footsoldier will basically be playing pretty much a load of Hardcore and Jungle tracks. Please buy your tokens at the cash box if you want to join this ride.
