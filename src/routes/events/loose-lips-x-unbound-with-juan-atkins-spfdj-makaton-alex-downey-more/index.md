The Cause, Ashley Rd, Tottenham—–– JUAN ATKINS (Metroplex)  
[https://www.facebook.com/JuanAtkinsTheOriginator](https://www.facebook.com/JuanAtkinsTheOriginator)The big man JUAN ATKINS needs no introduction – going under many names including 'the godfather of techno' and 'The Originator', he's widely renowned for pioneering the sound of techno that started out in Detroit in the 80s. His sets take audiences on a journey, effortlessly bridging the gap between classic and contemporary techno and electro. Come and get up close and personal with him before he tours his live CYBOTRON project…– MAKATON (Blueprint/Rodz-Konez/Voitax)  
[https://soundcloud.com/makaton](https://soundcloud.com/makaton)Steve Bailey AKA MAKATON is a legend in his own right, having been at the forefront of experimental techno since 1998. His unique production style leans heavily on dub, industrial, no wave and minimalism concepts and, after joining James Ruskin's Blueprint label has had 3 releases on the label. His electrifying live set has seen him play at Fabric, House of God in Birmingham, Concrete in Paris and Berghain and Tresor.– ALEX DOWNEY (Third Eye)  
[https://soundcloud.com/alex-downey](https://soundcloud.com/alex-downey)Freerotation resident ALEX DOWNEY is a true DJs DJ, having been described by Ben Sims as one of the few DJs who is a true natural. His legendary sets at Freerotation have seen him gain accolades and respect from peers all over the globe and have seen him play in the furthest-flung corners of the world. He broadly plays techno and electro, but his skills behind the decks see him able to shapeshift and slot in to any party with ease.– JEROME HILL (Don't/Super Rhythm Trax)  
[https://soundcloud.com/jeromehill](https://soundcloud.com/jeromehill)JEROME HILL began DJing and record collecting in 1990 then earning his stripes as a regular face behind the decks at London’s illegal warehouse scene of the mid nineties. The true-hearted music lover that he is, Jerome is not interested in dwelling in the past -he is more than anything about the next release, the next DJ set, proving each time that his musical knowledge and skill has value in the here and now.– SPFDJ (Intrepid Skin)  
[https://soundcloud.com/spfdj](https://soundcloud.com/spfdj)Fast-rising SPFDJ has been making waves with her uncompromising, tough style of mixing that sees her bringing a full-throttle, no holds barred experience to those watching her play. Blending together EBM, industrial techno, acid, trance, electro and more with a nuance and subtlety that you wouldn't expect from such intense music, we see very big things for her in the near future…– MEDALLION MAN b2b KORTZER (Loose Lips)
