Their EP “Aus Den Falten” (July 2018) appears on \[aufnahme+wiedergabe\]. Their music is being supported by DJs like Silent Servant, The Hacker, Helena Hauff, Samuel Kerridge, Phase Fatale, Adam X, Front 242, Jensen Interceptor, Tommy Four Seven and more.

The Duo consisting of ROMMEK & Aimée Mullen debut their first EP on Sacred Court on the 22nd of March! Expect a tribalistic mix of cyber-punk electronics and doom-laden soundscapes. Together, they utilise a range of vocals with classical and electronic instruments, to create a rich and twisted sound pallet.

These local legends will be gracing the turntables for us & we can't wait! Honing their jockeying skills through lengthy 8 hour sets individually & as a pair, they're 2 of the best about! Expect all things acidic, hypnotic & straight in your face from the Eastern Bloc pair!
