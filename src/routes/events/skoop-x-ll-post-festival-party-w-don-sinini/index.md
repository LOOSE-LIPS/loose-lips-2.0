As August once again draws to an inevitable close and Edinburgh breathes a cumulative sigh of relief, we invite you to come and celebrate making it through another year of The Fringe with us at The Wee Red Bar.  
RnB//Dancehall//Trap//Favela//Grime  
£5 OTD         11-3am          
Headlining this culturally diverse event is none other than hotly-tipped London RnB/Dancehall connoisseur Don Sinini. Fresh off the back of his recent EP release "Love in the Dance" and a banging Boiler Room set he's definitely one to watch.  
Joined by local sadboi duo Billy Got Waves X Joell whose recent EP "Wish You Well" received high praise from the likes of Complex magazine. Also on side will be Loose Lips bossman selecta, Medallion Man, Edinburgh afrobeat blender Yung Face (making his SKOOP debut) and the triumphant return of Baux Cat, going b2b with Dearly Beloved for a truly mind-boggling mix of madness.
