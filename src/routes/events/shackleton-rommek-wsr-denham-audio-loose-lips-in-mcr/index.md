It's 2018 and we're starting how we mean to go on in Manchester…Not only is our next party at our favourite venue in the city, The White Hotel, but we’ve got one of our favourite artists and one of bass music's most mysterious figures flying over from Berlin for a very special live set.If you’ve seen Shackleton before, you know what to expect. If you’ve been to The White Hotel before, you know what to expect. If you’ve been to a Loose Lips Party before, you know what to expect. Put all three together though and ya gunna have Kim and Aggy cleaning the gaff for weeks after.Blueprint Records/Loose Lips resident Rommek also joins us, alongside Sheffield’s up and coming bass trio Denham Audio and the incredible improvised string experiments of WSR. More residential support comes from none other than head honcho Medallion Man & Manchester resident Paxman. Full power hours, till they lock it off in the early ones.

– Rommek (Blueprint/Loose Lips) [https://soundcloud.com/rommek](https://soundcloud.com/rommek)If you know about Blueprint Records, you know this is the man to watch. As a recent emerging artist, Rommek has shown promising developments in his own sound, as well as carving his way into the current techno scene. His extensive interest in sound design is embedded within the atmospheric, dynamic and textured tracks he produces. More exciting material coming on Blueprint very soon…  
– Conor Thomas (The Death Of Rave/Fiktion/Boomkat) [https://soundcloud.com/rob\_booth/electronic-explorations-392-conor-thomas](https://soundcloud.com/rob_booth/electronic-explorations-392-conor-thomas)Conor runs The Death of Rave and Reel Torque labels, co-runs Boomkat Editions, as well as spinning records all over – including on NTS. He's also a personal favourite DJ of Shackleton's. Expect unique selections tending towards the grimmer and darker ends of modern electronic music's fringes.
