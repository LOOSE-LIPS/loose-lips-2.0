– Ekman (Bedouin) – MCR DEBUT[https://soundcloud.com/roeldijcks](https://soundcloud.com/roeldijcks)  
Counterfeiting reality since 1981.  
– No Moon (Mechatronica) [https://soundcloud.com/nomoontrax](https://soundcloud.com/nomoontrax)  
With a boastful set of productions No Moon seems to be able to provide us with warming, soft, delicate electro steeped full of complex breaks, as well as providing serious, peak time heavy artillery.  
We cant wait to hear what he'll have packed.  
– Kortzer & Treece (Loose Lips)[https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/loose-lips-takeover-limbo-radio-15th-march](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/loose-lips-takeover-limbo-radio-15th-march)  
Wow.
