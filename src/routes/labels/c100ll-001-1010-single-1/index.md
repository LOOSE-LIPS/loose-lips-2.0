![image](../imported/c100ll-001-1010-single-1/image4157.jpeg)Introducing 10/10, a unique collaborative single from labels C7NEMA100 & Loose Lips, joining forces to present a standout hip hop experiment, fusing raw production with burning lyricism and punk-inspired attitude.

Heavy acidic sonics from Parallel Action meets intense, confident and twisted raps, written and performed by Charlie Boy Manson, a mysterious character challenged by the constant plight of debauchery. Since first meeting in a smoked out London radio studio, the artists’ discovery of their common love for genre-bending electronics and poetic chronicles has inspired this new partnership, now being shared with the world for the first time.

The track drops us into a psychedelic arcade, cranking the funk valve up a notch, telling a rebellious story of hedonistic invincibility and freedom – a cocktail of grimey dystopian arrogance, trip-hop breaks, soundsystem basslines and lyrical gymnastics!

10/10 is the first taste of a forthcoming EP, ‘Parallel Action featuring. Charlie Boy Manson’, out early 2021 on vinyl & digital, available to pre-order on 11th December 2020.

Parallel Action is a brand new project and direction from producer and composer, Jude Greenaway, aka Scanone. Taking inspiration from Jude’s audio & visual work, this new approach has been a few years in the making and combines downtempo, trip hop, jazz and electronica with cinematic atmospheres. At the heart of the motivation behind Parallel Action is collaborative work with a range of innovative vocalists, storytellers and talented musicians, creating a sound that is emotionally engaging and seeping with darkly brewing intensity.

Charlie Boy Manson is a Manchester-based rapper and mysterious alter-ego. He tells his trip-like, self-obsessed stories in a uniquely poetic way, doing so via collaborations with forward-thinking producers from across the musical spectrum. Expect the pairing of lo-fi twisted rap with everything from Doom-esque beats to industrial misdemeanours.

“Dubbed as ‘one of the finest rap projects of 2018’ and described as ‘the north’s weirdest enigma with bars that warp time’ by keen fans on his Facebook page, Charlie Boy Manson is a force to be reckoned with as he is undoubtedly creating waves from Manchester’s underground music scene for UK Hip-Hop.” – Manchester’s Finest
