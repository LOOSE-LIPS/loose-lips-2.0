![image](../imported/ll012-masaki-uchida-xenolinguistics-lp/image4147.jpeg)Following up on the intricate and thought-provoking cassette from Berlin’s Circula, we're turning the tables to present this debut album from Japanese producer, Masaki Uchida. 

The mysterious composer presents his inaugural venture into album territory with a full length LP soaked in atmosphere, intimidating noise and razor sharp attention to detail. Uchida’s uncanny approach leaves the listener dazzled, moving from perturbed ambience and experimental sound design through to baffling broken rhythms. 

Xenolinguistics’ thoughtfulness comes from anger, prayer and sorrow. Despite sounding alternative in its construction, Masaki’s desire is to to share these expressions with popular culture. 

The album is rounded off by 2 remixes from Loose Lips crew members, Rico Casazza and T-Scale. Following Casazza’s masterful album of moody electro on Archipel earlier this year, the inspired Italian here covers ‘Logos’ in sophisticated breakbeats & moving instrumentation. Then T-Scale’s remix transforms the already overwhelming ‘Black Puzzle’ into a lengthy industrial labyrinth.
