Oooooh daym you do it well. This tune (available on bandcamp and soundcloud now) is simultaneously so rude and so inviting. I really don’t like doing track or album reviews, I find them to be a really boring way of promoting music whilst simultaneously indulging in the fantasy that us music journalists have some kind of objective understanding of what’s good. But this track is just perfect for me so I don't need to try and be objective, it's peak out of body pop, exactly the kind of thing I would play on my show, Kim Cosmik must have surely known this when she sent it to me (it's released on her label, Cybersoul).

It reminds me of early midtempo Electro classics like Cybotron’s 1983 tune Clear, and yet it doesn’t feel retro at all because the gritty RUDE beat is meshed into this web of utopian sass. It reminds me of a ridiculously good animated Netflix show called Arcane, it mixed elements of fantasy and steampunk, tracking the development of a very society whose sophisticated technology combines clockwork with intrinsically powerful materials. One character named Sevika has a bionic arm, containing a mechanism that pumps her veins with ‘Shimmer’, a translucent, radioactive liquid. Sevika is a villain in the show, but if she had a non-evil-twin sister who used shimmer to colour her hair and power her synthesizer, this would be the kind of music that she would make, designed to soundtrack illegal zeppelin raves. Exquisite.
