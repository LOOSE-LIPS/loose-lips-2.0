![image](../imported/ll017-va-volii-in-aid-of-ruff-sqwad-arts-foundation/image4153.jpeg)We are proud to present a very special V/A on Loose Lips, bringing together a range of artists from across the world who we’ve connected with throughout the last 6 years of our LL journey!

The wide range of music chosen echoes our passion for unique music from all horizons. From raucous soundsystem music of many forms through to pertinent poetry, crazy industrial experiments, chilling ambience and eccentric breakbeats.

Considering the vast amount of mad music on offer, we’ve split the V/A into two distinct volumes for you delve into:

– Vol.I – dancefloor pumpers, wild beats, uptempo and typically harder vibes. You’ll soon find yourself pulling off the most daring dance moves you’ve seen for the whole of lockdown, with a smile stretching to your ears…

– Vol.II – more heady, contemplative, leftfield leaning. Whilst still sometimes capable of making your limbs jiggle, this is an after-party soundtrack for weirdos!
