Long time due mix from very good friend and writer/editor for Loose Lips! Max sent us a hazey yet dancey mix, ranging from dirty acidic House to blurry Techno and Electro, through to funky Breaks, finishing off with some DnB!@mx\_dde“After connecting with Fred (aka Medallion Man @medallionman) via the internet, London, and Lisbon, since then, him and the crew have done a lot, spreading out from the London HQ, collaborating with all kinds of creative people to make club nights, pop-up events, radio shows, charity events and the like.With LL, I deal with reviews, interviews and other articles/content. It is great to receive new music, write about it, and connect all manner of artists, labels, musical pathways…I have managed to meet most of the crew, put on and play at some fun nights, like the one in Lisbon with Medallion Man (@medallionman) and Rommek (@rommek), or the recent @threadsradio bash in Berlin with the multi-skilled producer, DJ, and LL resident-kingpin T-Scale (@jef-t-scale).The idea to record this mix had been brewing for a while, so I just had to record it as a spur-of-the-moment thing one evening. In the end, it was pretty close to the original idea for the LL mix series, so here it is. Massive shoutout to Loose Lips and all the people I’ve met so far.I would also like to point out the artist of the first tune: DJ Junk (@dj-junk-3).  
Growing up in Bournemouth, Junk (Second to None) was active in the Hip-Hop scene (breaking, scratching, painting, running events and workshops and that). I would often come across the breakers’ loops and some scratching when going around town. Nowadays I think that him and his crew were probably one of the first routes into dance music, so I put one his breaking tracks to kick off the mix.”TRACKLIST:Undisclosed.www.loose-lips.co.uk
