Next up is a smooth and wonderful journey courtesy of Extrapolation!Blending current-news-related samples ran through pedals with a fascinating musical selection! Enjoy the travel without moving…@extrapolationrecords“Extrapolation is a haphazard record label and radio show run by Zander Mavor and Alex Macdonald. Based between Bristol and London, the label was established in 2017 with the release of the ‘Powerline EP’ by Brandon Vare, followed by the album ‘Dream Reading’ by Joe Herrick in 2018.Following our third release in January, an album entitled ‘Zygote Dawn’, second on the label by Preston based producer Brandon Vare, our ambition over the next year is to continue to put out music and we’re excited to have some new releases in the pipeline.The times we’re surrounded in proved impossible for us to get together, and the seismic shock this has had on different creative scenes and the artists, musicians, venue staff, promoters, clubs and everyone living paycheck to paycheck now not knowing when it’s next going to come is scary to think about. Holding out hope for brighter days ahead and wishing everyone the best.A small problem in our world we’ve had is that it slowly became clear we weren’t going to have the opportunity to meet up and record something for this mix. We’ve instead put something together between our individual isolation stations, with Alex starting by recording an hour or so of music over two sessions in London featuring music from Two Lone Swordsmen, Glen Velez, Fuxa & Neil McKay and Unknown Mobile, and from labels Temporize, 12th Isle, Index, Emotional Rescue and more.In response to the mix and hearing it for the first time, Zander then overdubbed live radio and guitar through reverb and delay pedals, alongside content from news reports, asmr videos that simulate being screened for covid-19, political speeches, a conspiracy theorist, and a Sam Harris podcast episode.https://extrapolationrecords.bandcamp.comCheck out their releases:‘Powerline EP’ by Brandon Vare:
