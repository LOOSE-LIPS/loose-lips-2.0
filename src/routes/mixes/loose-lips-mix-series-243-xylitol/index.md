Anxiety with rhyms and electronics…A special mix recorded in anticipation of the Electro Cafe event in Bristol Xyitol is gracing on the 25th October – https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1308728.https://www.facebook.com/xylitolmusicXylitol is the twenty year-young electro project of artist and actor Catherine Backhouse. Xylitol’s music channels the brutal minimalism of early grime, cold-wave and the stoic synths of krautrock.“My approach has never been about the acquisition of new gear, not so much out of any ideological position as economic necessity, and trying to draw out these impossible imaginative spaces and see how I could squeeze this idea out with the limited technical means at my disposal.”Tracklist:
