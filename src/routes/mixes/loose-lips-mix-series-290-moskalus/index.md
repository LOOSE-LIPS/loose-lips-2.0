A free ticket to a virtual dancefloor, from the legendary Moskalus, who we eventually met properly last year in Czech Republic – with the @audiovideobass crew, where they hosted the Ostrava leg of our LL 5th Anniversary tour at Rapzzz Place.Here, expect low-ceiling, smoke-filled basement vibes, with imaginations of punters pumping next to massive sub woofers.@moskalus“Doing a mix for Loose Lips was an great opportunity to do something UK sounding. So I have decided to do this UK Bass mix with little bit of Breaks and UK Garage.”Marek Moskal (aka Moskalus) was born and currently resides in Ostrava, Czech Republic. He started his musical journey back in 2007 when he created his first YouTube channel where he would upload music from various artists to help them promote their music. With his second channel, he started doing music videos because he wanted to be a part of the scene, not only as a regular uploader, but as someone who wanted to express his own feelings. In November 2014, he had his first big break by making the music video for Bambounou’s track “Onto This” which was released on 50Weapons. After that, he gained a greater audience that helped him to work with labels such as: Lobster Theremin, Shall Not Fade, Die Orakel, Pinkman and Lehult. He has also had the opportunity to work with artists such as: Baltra, Fjaak, J. Albert and Benedict Frey.After years of listening to music and making videos for such artists, Moskalus has developed a wide-ranging taste. In his DJ sets you can expect to hear anything from disco to house, techno, UK Garage or dubstep from the golden era.And his years of engagement have translated into a deadly recipe for the dance floor. You can hear him jamming it at his infamous Audio Video Bass parties, or right here, for the 290th edition of our Loose Lips Mix Series!https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMoskalus
