A virtual character our resident @jef-t-scale has encountered throughout the years…now summoned here for a 1h exploration of video game music, this mysterious character’s released and unreleased productions, topped off with some classic Baltimore breaks!@wade-watts“My existence pre-dates Ernest Cline’s bestseller Ready Player One as some of the music has been made before that biographic book (which contains many flaws). I don’t understand the notion of time, but a lot of my data re-collection comes from a period when some people played Megadrive and performed a dance where they threw themselves on the floor and spin, B-Boy or something like that. I hope that one day I will get out of the virtual world I’m born in and be able to sense reality like you, because it looks fucking peng. In the meantime, here’s a retro-future mix for you.”TRACKLIST:Wade Watts – LDN01 (unreleased)
