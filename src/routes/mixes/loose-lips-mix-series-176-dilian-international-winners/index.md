The mix tries to synthesise what’s appealing to Dilian, an artist who we’ve become very close to since we released a track from his ‘Gap’ alias on our LL010 compilation.http://loose-lips.co.uk/label/ll010-va-in-aid-of-the-refugee-community-kitchenThe mix is a synthesis of today’s club and dance scenes – a combination of classic beats with newer African and Portuguese/Brazilian dance styles that have come to highly enrich the genre these days. Dilian’s sets are dynamic, varying in intensity, keeping it interesting and allowing listening in a club, or on your phone whilst decorating! Experimental weird zones!<iframe loading="lazy" title="Dilian" width="640" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F257501&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;maxwidth=640&amp;maxheight=960&amp;dnt=1"></iframe>Dilian makes music under his own name and as ‘Gap’, out of Brooklyn, NY. Mainly focusing on experimental electronic dance and club sounds. He has published a 7’’ vinyl and a couple of mixtapes (the latest one of which was released in Jan 2018). He’s played in pretty much all venues in the NYC area (Knockdown Center, Bossa Nova Civic Club, H0l0, Park Church Co-op, Secret Project Robot, Silent Barn, Palisades, Trans Pecos, Aviv, Shea Stadium, Babycastle, etc.), other US towns, and has toured Europe annually since 2015.Dilian co-operatively runs Int’l Winners Collective which organises shows, puts out music, and sustains a monthly radio show on Bel-Air radio in NYC and on 199Radio in London.He’s also made music for award winning documentaries and children films…check check check it!TRACKLIST:Ase Manual – Fortune Power Fame (ft.
