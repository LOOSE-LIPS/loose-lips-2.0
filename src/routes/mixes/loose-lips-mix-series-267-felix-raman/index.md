We’re delighted for this week’s mix series edition to announce our brand new Loose Lips resident!London-based Felix Raman is an incredible DJ and incredible human, with an eclecticism and looseness that makes him perfect for the family! Look forward to him now being a regular feature at our London parties and beyond…This mix says it all! Distorted music for a distorted time – the mix was recorded in Homerton on Pioneer 350s, some crusty Kam Turntables, and a Behringer mixer!https://soundcloud.com/felixstock-1Songs for the grey…this mix focuses on the winter and the feelings short days and long nights bring. Some old tracks and some new but all very important to Felix.“I feel lucky to be inspired constantly by the people around me: Tracks by S43 and SWARMM are the work of two amazing producers and my good friends. Watch their new label Luminar Flow for your grandkid’s favourite tunes.  
Blawan’s Remix of ‘Black Rose’ by Source Direct was the tune from the 4K party days in Hackney Wick. ‘Kreen’ by Struction was the first record I bought when I moved to Berlin in 2017 and has been a personal anthem since then. ‘Respond to Call’ by Rory St John showed me that transients aren’t necessary. ‘Dualism’ by Thelem & Killawatt connected some 140 and techno dots. ‘Bad Hands (break part ii)’ by Surgeon is basically as good as techno gets for me and ‘Pottlin’ by AYA was the track I ended with when I played my first Loose Lips party at the Cause in February 2019.”<iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="Penshawdelay by Felix Raman" scrolling="no" width="640px" height="1305px" frameborder="no" src="https://backl.ink/104870220?layout=oembed#?secret=XoVULfcyDR" data-secret="XoVULfcyDR"></iframe>Felix Raman is a Producer, DJ and Mix and Mastering Engineer, working within a range of styles and groups.
