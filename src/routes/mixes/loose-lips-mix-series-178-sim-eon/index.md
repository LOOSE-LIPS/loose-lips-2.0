Here’s a set recorded by Sim Eon at the ‘BeeSpace’ event @ New River Studios, London on 13th May 2018, which was raising funds and awareness for the preservation of bees.@beespace @bionisamp-1“This sound bonanza was conceived and curated by the gentle genius, and my dear friend, (often known by the DJ moniker of ‘Bioni Samp’), to raise funds for the preservation of the bee population – a genuinely vital cause, and one which he spearheads in the London area. I hope anyone listening will enjoy my odd mix of genres here, ranging from Kraut Rocky cosmic type stuff, through to New Beat & Techno, and all sorts of other bizarreness sandwiched in between. I tried to pick buzzy sounds and vague references to colonies for obvious reasons.”TRACKLIST:Tross – Colonization \[Space Ritual\]
