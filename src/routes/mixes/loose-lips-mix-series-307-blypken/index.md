A sensory melting pot of deep, extravagant, comical, caustic, swag and more condensed into 41′!@blypkenGeorge D. Stănciulescu (b.1982) is a Romanian electronic music producer, composer/sound-designer and digital music theorist. George is a graduated psychologist (2006), has a MA in cultural management (2009) and has a PhD in philosophy of digital music and new media (2012, Alexandru I. Cuza University of Iaşi).He also specialised further in Paris (two fellowships in 2010 and 2011 at IDEAT and Sorbonne University), under the guidance of French professor and composer of Romanian origin, Costin Miereanu. The book version of his doctoral thesis, entitled “Postmodern and digimodern music. Philosophical perspectives”, was published at the beginning of 2014 by Editura Muzicală, with an introduction by Romanian composer and professor Octavian Nemescu.Through original concepts such as “pseudo-naturalization”, “techno-poietic renaturalization”, “hypersound icon”, “uchronic/diachronic performatism” among others, Blypken’s research is some of the first in Romania to deeply explore the metaphysical and phenomenological nature of virtual sound creation and computer-based music in postmodern culture.http://blypken.com
