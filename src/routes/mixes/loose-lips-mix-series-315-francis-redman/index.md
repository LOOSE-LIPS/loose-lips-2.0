loose-lips.co.uk/blog/francis-redmans-hopeful-dawn“In some respects this mix jumps off from my Hopeful Dawn picks for Loose Lips earlier this month; like most people I have been concerned with what has been going on in the world in recent times – there is a lot to worry about, but there are also always things to rouse us with hope.On my Threads Radio Show I have been engaging with thoughts about nature recently – and more specifically our relationship with it. These are the things I was thinking about as I put this together – as we approach another spring in this turbulent stasis we find ourselves in. ”Francis Redman is a broadcaster and DJ, he presents a monthly show on Threads Radio and runs a small record label called Trouble in Utopia.Photo Credit: georginacook.netTRACKLIST:Ellen Arkbro – For Organ and Brass
