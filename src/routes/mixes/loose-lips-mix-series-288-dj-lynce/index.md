We’re inviting you to dive into this out-of-time mix from Portuguese DJ and avid record collector, DJ Lynce. Digging from obscure lo-fi electronic dub through to early electro gems and many other fascinating pieces of music that defy genres and classification.@pedrosantosAlthough this may sound paradoxical, DJ Lynce embodies both the character of the ultimate anti-DJ and of a definite “must-to” within the city’s musical scene.Owner of a rather idiosyncratic record collection which he de-manipulates with a faultless technique, Lynce’s peculiarity creates something intelligible and poetic to mould around a club goers expectations.This method of operations has produced some really oblique and one-of-a-kind DJ sets; sound pieces that translate to Portuguese the motto “for those who know”.https://www.instagram.com/\_lynce\_
