Number 254 comes straight from Bushey, Hertfordshire from our very own Dog Eyes. A DJ and radio host known to specialise in left-of-field, fringe electronic music, and its extended contemporaries, remains faithful to his style within the mix. He is the sole founder of Index Tapes – a “fortmonthly” show aired on Threads radio.@indextapesHe has worked with and collaborated with artists such as Best Available Technology (Opal Tapes, Working Nights), Less Distress (C O U P) and Omori (Amek Collective), and has played shows at Boomtown Fair Festival, Ransom Note Records and has recently played in Ostrava and at Cross Club in Prague as part of the CZ leg on our 5th Anniversary Tour!The Index Tapes identity looks to expand its operation into a fully-fledged community project by means of releasing very limited runs of cassette tapes in a prolific fashion, with the sole purpose of serving the artists both artistically and financially, implementing fair treatment for their craft. Inherently, this makes the project in itself, non-profit. The project looks to debut its first release in early 2020 from a Toronto artist known only as HEC.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deindex
