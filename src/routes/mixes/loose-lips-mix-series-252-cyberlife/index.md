Paris-based Cyberlife is our 252nd entry! A 3-hour mix evolving at its own pace from Drone into Bass and Drum & Bass territories.  
Here’s some time very well spent!@cyberlife-musicBoth DJ and producer inspired by a wide range of electronic genres, between Dub Techno, IDM, Drum & Bass, tribalistic World Music, Ambient, Trip-Hop & psychedelic music.  
Cyberlife, who got rooted years ago in the techno culture, brings the ambition to shape a very personal style, surfing on forward thinking, psychedelic, hypnotic and melancholic vibes. By applying layers of effects on stretched field recordings or destructured analogue synth jams on a large scale of tempos, the exploration of the meanders of the matrix of electronic music defines his director line, with an aim to find transcendence and reveal a futuristic and organic universe rooted to some old school influences. Don’t look for the nerd behind this name, keep the mystery and unpredictability, and share a musical mindtrip.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/cyberlife.music
