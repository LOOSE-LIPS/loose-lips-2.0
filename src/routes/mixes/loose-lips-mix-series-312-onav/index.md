Punching through the end of 2020, @sisu\_crew’s ona:v races between electro, breaks, techno, ghettotech and hardtech in this 2h26m crescendo.@ona\_veraA scientist by day and a DJ by night, Polish-born and Edinburgh-based ona:v began DJing in Edinburgh clubs in 2019. With distinctive taste for fast-paced and energetic tracks, she packs her DJ mixes with high-energy electro and techno. With the current techno scene being out of underground and subject to market forces, she finds gems amongst old and lesser known tracks/artists, to create her own sound.She is an advocate for fxmale representation in the electronic music industry and believes the best way to increase the proportion of womxn in the electronic music world is platforming…and so, her mixes and sets always feature amazing tracks by amazing womxn producers! To further promote womxn DJs, together with another Scottish DJ, KT.K, ona:v founded an all-female electro/techno DJ collective EPiKA. The aim of EPiKA is to promote womxn playing heavier flavours of electronic music through organising a series of fxmale-led nights in Edinburgh and to create a welcoming and supportive environment for beginner fxmale DJs. EPiKA’s launch night was scheduled for April 2020 and cancelled due to the COVID pandemic, but plans are under way for 2021. ona:v also uses one of her radio residencies to promote fxmale DJs by inviting fxmale and non-binary DJs to record mixes for her monthly show on Edinburgh’s EH-FM community radio (CiRCLE by ona:v). To make the clubbing world more welcoming, she also runs a meetup page, where strangers can meet and join her and her friends for electronic nights out.Despite the pandemic closing clubs (in Scotland, clubs have not opened since late March), 2020 was busy for ona:v. In February, she played at the launch of electro-only night by the Scottish electro collective SLR. After clubs closed, she has participated in numerous streams and recorded a number of quality mixes for podcasts and radio shows – for example for Scottish labels Animal Farm and Hilltown Disco. She also has become part of the Sisu roster and secured two radio residencies (the already mentioned EH-FM residency as CiRCLE, and Fnoob Techno Radio residency as ReView).TRACKLIST:
