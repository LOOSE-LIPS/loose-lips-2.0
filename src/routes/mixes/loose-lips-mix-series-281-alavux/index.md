Up next in this weekly series of sensations, we have a great friend and producer of sublime Electro & Techno!Look forward to a balanced dosage of machine funk and raw power, in this mix made up mostly of his own Alavux unreleased material!@alavux“I’ve been effin’ with Alavux musically for a couple of years now. I even interviewed him back when I was conducting interviews with electro scenesters on a semi-regular basis. What I most dig about the brother is his gritty raw take on warehouse music – his beats don’t sound like they were meticulously crafted in some cold dark laboratory; they sound like they were made by a man who pounded back a pint or two, lit a blunt and worked the f–k out of his gear. Pure passion, designed to keep asses movin’ on the dancefloor. This music transcends techno or electro – it’s for kopfickers and booty shakers, and demands to be played loud.” By Madden Wachsenhoff (www.djmadwax.com)TRACKLIST:1\. Alavux – Airlock Door
