For today’s edition of our Mix Series we have analog don Timothy J. Fairplay delivering an hour long electro mix that includes a wonderful array of tracks ranging from the 80s, 90s & 00s, through to current tracks.@timothy-j-fairplayTimothy describes his electro sets as generally having a ‘Detroit-like feel’, regardless of the origin of songs. He singles out the AS1 track by Arnold Steiner, in this mix, whose release on Metroplex has been a favourite of his for the past couple of years. Also, Timothy drew special attention to the last two tracks by DJ Maaco, a producer who he holds in high regard who is part of Cybotron’s touring lineup.https://www.facebook.com/timothyfairplay
