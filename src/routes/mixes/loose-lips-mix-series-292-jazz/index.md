Introducing JAZZ to our mix series for 120′ of techno, electro, breakbeat and UKG from Two Shells, DJ Plead, Deadboy, LSDXOXO, Main Phase, Puglist, K-Lone and many more, with one common denominator: positive energy!“Like most of my mixes, I wanted to take listeners through a deep journey, starting off with slowed down blends, through to high-energy beats, rhythms and mixed vocals to create an intense, feel good mix. Something that shouts ‘we’re nearly there .. on the dancefloor together, grooving and head bopping’.”!TRACKLIST:\-undisclosed-www.loose-lips.co.uk
