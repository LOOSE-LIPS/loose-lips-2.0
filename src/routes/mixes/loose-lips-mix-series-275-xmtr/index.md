Our 275th mix series is from XMTR, firing a deflagration of breakbeats and non-linear rhythms in this highly enjoyable 1h journey!We met Jago in London at @threadsradio and have since been really impressed by all of his recent mixes (radio and club) that we’ve heard. Stylish yet rude, perfect for the Mix Series!This mix is an extension of his PICKS feature for our blog, here – http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/picks-xmtrs-headphone-freakouts@xmtr“During these times of isolation many of us are missing weekends in sweaty clubs listening to huge soundsystems under jarring lightshows.However, good can come from spending time away from the club scene. I’ve been listening to music more without needing to consider whether the track is a ‘club tool’ or how the dance floor would react to it.So here are some tracks with impossibly complex drum programming, or wonderfully weird breakdowns with that little bit extra that might not fully work in a club setting, but are perfect for a home listen.” XMTRTRACKLIST:XMTR – ???
