@pmgrecordingsBorn 1972 in Skopje.Buying records and taking good care of his music since the earliest days of elementary school.Progressing into being a birthday party DJ in the early 80s.“Most music was cool all around in the 80s. Even pop music was the greatest ever.”Such a creative environment helped him develop a healthy curiosity and divergent musical taste, which would be decisive in the future…First professional DJ booking in 1992.Probably the busiest DJ in the whole of Macedonia since…Regular at Kanal 103 (alternative FM radio station) since 1992.Free expression can work wonders if used creatively…Editor in chief at Kanal 103 between 2008-2010 and 2012-2016.1993 finds him at the core of the Macedonian techno-cultural revolution. Very important time for changing cultural habits and finally putting Skopje on the map…In 1995, he starts PMG Collective – a real life manifesto against what he saw as the backward state of Macedonian society.In the following years, PMG becomes one of the most influential artistic organisations in modern day Macedonian pop culture – with it’s radical avant-garde deeds on the streets, it sparked all kinds of changes and novelties, from drug euphorias to musical revolutions…PMG party in the 90s become the essence of Skopje’s urban folklore at the time.Mirko Popov continues to tour, both in Macedonia and internationally!1998 sees the launch of PMG Recordings, an independent Macedonian record label, celebrating new Macedonian sounds, aiming to do justice to the country’s extremely talented, but mainly unrecognised, modern musiciansThe label has since put out 170 releases!2003 – he puts together PMG Kolektiv, the band. Showcasing his creativity, writing music and lyrics, and singing in the band. PMG Kolektiv is now one of the leading independent bands in Macedonia, successfully releasing albums (8 so far) and consistently touring.Another band project then evolved – an obscure-cult electronic group called Kanton6, who have released 3 albums, and a little something called #MakedonideCrew.Now also composes and sings with a legendary local jazz band, Sethstat (1 album so far).2018 – PMG Jazz launches, a label devoted to jazz music, w/ 7 releases since. This then also leads to the creation of another label, Makedonide!2019 – Mirko starts PMG Tanz Digital, an electronic dance net-label, with the intention of capturing the experience and spiritual momentum of a PMG dancefloor!The last few years of the XX century have seen Mirko’s first house/techno/electro productions, reaching the ears of many Macedonian clubbers.What more!?
