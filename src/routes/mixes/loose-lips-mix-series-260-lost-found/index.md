Back in November, our 5th Anniversary tour landed in Berlin, with a collaborative event with Voidance Records popping off at Maze Bar! The man who made that possible, Ali Amel, aka Lost & Found, co-founder of Voidance, has put together the 260th mix in our series.Many memories of that incredible week in Germany come flooding back…especially the Skepta tune he’s included that had us gun-fingering for days on end!@lostandfounddjHailing from London, Iranian born electronic music producer Lost & Found is now a permanent resident in Berlin, Germany.“In this line of work, living in a place which no longer harvested club culture made no sense, which is why I left London.”L&F’s life was a mixture of Iranian values growing alongside an ever-enriching London culture. He was of a generation that flourished under communities that had families from Nigeria, Lebanon, Ghana, Jamaica, Morocco to name a few.Growing up within Portobello market, West London, he was exposed to many styles of music through pirate radio stations, record shops, clubs and of course the famous Notting Hill Carnival. These mediums are what introduced him to his own particular style, that you hear today.Lost & Found’s main love came in the shape of Jungle & Garage music – “the sounds were raw & gritty, it was such a representation of London’s streets. It was our identity & sound”. His passion for being a Londoner shines through in his musical productions and DJing still now, whilst at the same time taking influence and creative energy from the magical city he’s now based in, a place he considers the mecca of electronic music.L&F’s musical output and work also extends beyond his productions to collaborations with business partner, Hammy Havoc – together they score movies & game soundtracks, together with running an label called Voidance Records which pushes the sounds touched on above – check it out!www.voidancerecords.comTracklist:
