Benny and Toby have constructed loads of little loops, broken them down into their component parts, then put them back together, kind of like a musical jigsaw, to create a unique, one-off continual mix of music.They’ve done two before, at 110bpm and 120bpm as Nord Suburban Genossenschaft, but they’re using that name for a more political project now, so this is the first one they’ve done as BBS.It’s 96bpm all the way through, it’s a moody, heavy beast and it’s right up Loose Lips’ street. A bit wonky and a bit woozy, but still full of grooves!https://www.facebook.com/blackbeaconsoundintlCheck out our recent interview with them here – http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/black-beacon-sound.TRACKLIST: Black Beacon Sound – You Got A Fiver?1\.
