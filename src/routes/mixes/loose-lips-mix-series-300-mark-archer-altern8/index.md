For 300 weeks, we’ve been releasing a new edition of our Mix Series every Thursday/Friday, showcasing inspiring DJs and producers from across the spectrum.To celebrate, Altern 8 legend, Mark Archer, has put together our 300th – a concoction of true energetic rave, old skool flavours and more recent hardcore-inspired goodness!Having such a guest on our series is an honour; a man who has been part of influential UK dance music acts such as Bizarre Inc., Nexus 21, and a cult duo that soon became the dust mask and hazmat suit-wearing act known as Altern 8, who from 2015 included Posthuman’s Josh Doherty alongside Mark. Wearing a mask ain’t that bad after all!All we can say is that we’re gassed as f\*ck and that we’ve been playing these breakbeats over and over…what a treat – enjoy!http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/altern8s-mark-archer-raves-up-our-300th-mix-series@mrnex
