Back in May 2019, @medallionman & @auderkortzer organised a @threadsradio pop-up stream in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NYC. One of the DJs invited by @international-winners, the wicked crew who were co-curating it, was Ryan Scannura, the man behind Deep Club, a record label and party based in Denver, Colorado.They immediately clicked, adored the set that followed, and fell in love with the most recent release Deep Club release they were shown (https://soundcloud.com/deepclubus/occidental-grey-people-trespass-cop-watch-12-ep-clip-deep-club-05). The rest is history – enjoy this wonderful mix, which is a direct result of that wonderful day!https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/ryanscannura

It accurately depicts the music I am feeling lately – deep, soulful, mostly black American house music. New records mixed with old records, but it is all timeless. Almost all of the records are pitched down to make the mix more headphone-friendly, but also I like that the kicks and bass have more room to breathe. A few of my favorite defenders of the deep house sound are represented here, including Chez Damier, Brawther, Norm Talley, Mike Huckaby, Krimp (RIP), DJ Spinna, and DJ Rasoul.”  
– Ryan“Deep House is best described as warm colourful sounds, emotional chords, and melodies that strike a feeling of peace within the listener. The feeling generated by a banging peak hour dance floor tune with epic builds is the same feeling inside the mind of a Deep House head. It just takes half the amount of energy to generate this feeling with Deep House. That’s the greatest thing about Deep House.”
