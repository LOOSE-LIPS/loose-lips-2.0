We’ve been listening to his tunes since day dot…“The focus was to create something that sounded like you were there, so the approach was to simply groove on whatever loops were up at the time and focus less on creating a cohesive song, allowing the human element to peek through. The result was a really engaging recording, something that felt more like a house party. Im really happy that Loose Lips reached out and asked me to do this. About a year ago I played one of their parties and this set reminds me of that night, honest and personal.”Gear used – Moog Model D, SQ1, TR707, Circuit x2, TB-3!Wonderful memories – http://loose-lips.co.uk/events/loose-lips-london-winter-rave-with-dmarc-cantu-galaxian-shinrahttps://www.facebook.com/dmarccantuD’Marc Cantu is an American producer who has built up an enviable discography of work over the last 15 years plus. As well as working under his own name, he has secured underground hits as 2 AM/FM in collaboration with Tadd Mullinix, and helped define a sound that became known as JakBeat. Using a selection of hardware tools and analogue machines, his rugged sound draws on house, techno, acid, electro and hip hop and features crafty studio skills, knowing sampling and lovable raw aesthetics. To date it has found D’Marc release on influential labels like Nation, Creme Organization, Altered Moods and Spectral Sound as well as M>O>S Recordings, New York Haunted and Run Out Run. Always conjuring up new feelings and ideas with each release, he is an artist that never stops evolving and is always looking to the future. Full length albums like Fallen and A New World both prove he has an expensive sound, but one that is coherent and considered and works as well on the dance floor as it does during more personal moments of introspection.Alongside his fascinating original material, he has remixed everyone from Azimuth to Aroy Dee to Richard Fearless and has put out compilations for Dope Jams. Highlights in his back catalogue include 2009’s Another Number on Crème and 2011’s Set Free, hailed as a modern classic, on MOS, whilst the future holds more of the same on labels like Nation, Shaddock and Sequencias. As such, this vital voice in the electronic underground remains as loud and clear as ever.
