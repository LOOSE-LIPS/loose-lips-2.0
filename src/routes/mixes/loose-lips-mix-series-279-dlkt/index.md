Our 279th mix is full of positive energy and rave dynamics – ranging from house and lo-fi through to all kinds of other rave-o-licious goodies.We met Martin, aka DLKT, at our 5th Anniversary tour stop in Ostrava last October. We were welcomed beautifully by his ‘Banket’ crew and the night was closed out by a killer set from him, that inspired us to ask him to join this series!@dlkt\_avb “The place where I live is often considered to be part of ‘the East’. East of my country (Czech Republic) or East of Europe. The label refers to something exotic at best, so at times it can be challenging to cope with the decision to do dance music here.

Greetings to London from East-Central Europe.”https://www.facebook.com/dlktavb

The crew is gathered around the idea of organising audio-visual events in a city where deindustrialisation has left an overwhelming about of free space.In November 2019, AVB’s regularly held Banket party series (http://bnkt.cz) became one of the hosts of the Loose Lips 5th Anniversary Tour.   @audiovideobass
