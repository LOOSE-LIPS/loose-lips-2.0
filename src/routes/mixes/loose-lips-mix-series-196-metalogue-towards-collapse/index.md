Science-fiction involving mysterious or abnormal ‘zones’ is a massive inspiration for Metalogue. Roadside Picnic (Arkady and Boris Strugatsky), Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky), the Jeamland in Michael Marshall Smith’s Only Forward, the Southern Reach trilogy (Jeff VanderMeer) and more recently the Tanis podcast (Terry Miles) are prominent examples.This mix for takes the main motif of Edward Artemiev’s Stalker soundtrack as a starting point and explores musical and thematic associations from artists working with ambient, soundtrack and post-industrial genres. No collection of music dealing with this subject could be complete without Robert Rich & B. Lustmord’s timeless album Stalker (1995), whilst Pauline Oliveros & Stuart Dempster’s Deep Listening (1989) also stands out as it is inspired directly by extraordinary physical environments.The Metalogue tracks he has woven into this set reference these fictions in some way as well. The title ‘We Are Home’ (Indefinite Divisibility) paraphrases the first words Tarkovsky’s Stalker says when he arrives in the Zone, whilst the concluding tracks Outer Margin and Apposition Breach (both unreleased) are part of a new album which explores these ideas in more detail.@metalogueMetalogue is the solo alias of musician/programmer Robin Fencott (London, UK). Metalogue combines IDM, ambient, industrial and breakcore with cinematic sound design, experimental practice and electroacoustics. Metalogue’s previous releases include Paroxysm (Section Twentyseven), Valiha and Indefinite Divisibility, in addition to remixes for artists including Huron (Mindtrick), Scald Process (Holotone) and Savier (Darkfloor).Robin is one half of the post-rock/IDM outfit Microscopists (Abstrakt Reflections), co-organises the dark ambient/industrial club night Towards Collapse, and has a collaborative album with producer/vocalist Fluff.TRACKLIST:1\.
