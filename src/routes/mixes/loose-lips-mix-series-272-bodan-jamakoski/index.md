@audiobahn101 Bodan Jamakoski is a Macedonian DJ and producer from Skopje, Macedonia.  
His career started seven years ago as part of the renowned Macedonian collective BTKRSH. After spending a couple of years DJing and being resident in some of the clubs in Skopje, he started focusing on his own music production.He has released EP’s for Juan’s Kitchen Delights Recordings, PMG Recordings and TMM , his passion for sharing and promoting quality electronic music inspired him to start the project Audiobahn in collaboration with a friend.  
Audiobahn is the first live streaming platform in Macedonia, conceived as a place for promoting quality electronic music, performances and art through different kinds of events and ambients.Years later, the concept of Audiobahn has expanded into organizing live streamed events at unusual “hidden” locations around Skopje, with limited invitations, which sparked a huge interest by the electronic music lovers.  
Another successful project of his, a collaboration with Dusko Janevski is Databahn: a composition of numerous events with a unique identity, happening every couple of months at different venues, at which new electro and techno music is promoted.This winter season, Bodan started performing as a resident DJ at club Minus 1, along with being the booking manager.   https://www.mixcloud.com/bjamakoski/
