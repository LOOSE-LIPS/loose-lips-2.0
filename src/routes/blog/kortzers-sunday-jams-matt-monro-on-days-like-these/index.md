![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-matt-monro-on-days-like-these/image784.jpeg)Matt Monro, dubbed "The Man With The Golden Voice" brings this week';s selection in the shape of "On Days Like These". The track is most commonly known for being the opening track in The Italian Job and even though the track never charted in either the UKor the US, it is recognised as one of his most famous tracks. The track was written by non other than the legendary Quincy Jones, as well as being produced by the equally infamous George Martin. The lyrics were also penned by Don Black who has worked for many famous artists, as well as co-writing some of the James Bond theme songs (including "Diamonds Are Forever"). Monro';s silky baritone voice suits any Sunday and I hope it winds down your weekend in style.
