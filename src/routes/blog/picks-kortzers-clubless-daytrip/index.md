![image](../imported/picks-kortzers-clubless-daytrip/image1226.jpeg)Over quarantine we';ve had a fantastic variety of guest selectors step up for Picks, but today we';re on home turf with our very own saucey sorcerer supreme, Mancunian Loose Lips resident DJ and previous ';Sunday Jams'; captain, [Kortzer](http://loose-lips.co.uk/crew/kortzer)!!! Following on in [S/S](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/picks-sss-soul-funk-psych-rock-daytrip) and [Sugarglider](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/picks-the-sugargliders-lima-day-trip)';s footsteps, the livest bloke in Blightey takes us on a rare serene daytrip; "a dawn til dusk look into some favourite bits from my record collection that wouldn';t necessarily get played out otherwise" (no EBM, sorry lads, change into a nice dry top and light some incense). All tracks but one gathered in this [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6HE6CgE3QQKg5vDP51EJZQ?si=AGHjvchDQmqlkiR-PaNl-Q), take it away K-man!

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/i62tbi6wcW8?wmode=opaque'></iframe>This track (as well as the C Cat Trance track later on in the playlist) features on Prins Thomas';s _Paradise Goulash,';_an epic compilation that';s well worth a listen! This track reminds me of the music from Scarface and sounds like weird space age spa music, which I';ll have a bit of please.';

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/6zqOe7uyOBA?wmode=opaque'></iframe>This album again in itself is incredible, full of amazing samples. This track is proper tranquil and relaxing and unique boombap style beat.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/auzfYGCE-TA?wmode=opaque'></iframe>At this point I';m running out of words in my vocabulary but I';d go as far as to say that this one is sick.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/E7RezbcP86Q?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I bought this when I was first getting into mixing and has always had a special space in my collection, I love the range of different instruments.';
