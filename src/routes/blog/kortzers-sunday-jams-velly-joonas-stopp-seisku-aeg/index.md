![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-velly-joonas-stopp-seisku-aeg/image778.jpeg)This week';s selection comes in the form of Velly Joonas';s Stopp Seisku Aeg. The track was recorded in Soviet era Estonia and is an insightful look into what kind of music was being made behind "The iron Curtain" at what was creatively quite an oppressive period of time. Although recorded in 1980/83 the track wasn';t actually released until 2015. I remember when I first heard the track I was amazed that this was what was being made in the 80';s in a Soviet state, its also interesting that Velly was able to cover a western track. Velly is now 63 and teaches in a primary school in Estonia. She';s said to have written close to 300 songs as well as writing poetry. The song is an elegant piece of soul/funk tied together by dreamy synths and despite not being able to understand the lyrics, emotionally the track translates beautifully. I hope this amazing piece of music fits into your Sunday and closes of whats been a wonderful weekend.
