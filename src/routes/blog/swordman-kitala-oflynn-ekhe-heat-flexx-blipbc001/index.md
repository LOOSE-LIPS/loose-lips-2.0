The infection was aggressive, spread to his brain and consequently caused a lesion in his right thalamus – in layman’s terms, a stroke. He was unresponsive for days in hospital and couldn’t talk or even move a finger for weeks.To everyones relief, he has since partially recovered. His cognitive function seems unaffected but he certainly still needs a lot more physio/speech therapy to make what we hope will be a full recovery that could enable him to get his life and music back.Unfortunately, healthcare in Uganda isn’t free. 100% of the proceeds from this release will go to Swordman Kitala.
