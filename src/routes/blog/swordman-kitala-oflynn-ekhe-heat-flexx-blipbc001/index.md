[](https://soundcloud.com/ekhebeats)[https://soundcloud.com/ekhebeats](https://soundcloud.com/ekhebeats)**Swordman Kitala needs our help**Swordman Kitala has run into some bad health '; shortly after he was being lauded following his debut release on Blip Discs, he fell ill with typhoid. The infection was aggressive, spread to his brain and consequently caused a lesion in his right thalamus '; in layman';s terms, a stroke. He was unresponsive for days in hospital and couldn';t talk or even move a finger for weeks.To everyones relief, he has since partially recovered. His cognitive function seems unaffected but he certainly still needs a lot more physio/speech therapy to make what we hope will be a full recovery that could enable him to get his life and music back.Unfortunately, healthcare in Uganda isn';t free. 100% of the proceeds from this release will go to Swordman Kitala.
