The tune that started off the best part of my day, set up all the notes and just cheered everything up. I';m keeping it really short, all you have to do is put it on, that simple. Let it take you somewhere, listen in front a window, a skylight, in your garden if you have one, find light and maybe this can act like a musical charge to help you get through to the next bit.It';s _Reach For The Sun_ by Polyphonic Spree. This is Pop mastery. It';s full and layered, it manages to be epic and yet it';s also full of pockets. The act of many voices coming together in unison creates an otherworldly sort of magic. It';s an electronic and sonic partnership of the highest order, a tapestry not a half and half. So do it. Reach for the sun. Enjoy.
