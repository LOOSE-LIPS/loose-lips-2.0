[](https://soundcloud.com/slipperysounds)[https://soundcloud.com/slipperysounds](https://soundcloud.com/slipperysounds)To celebrate a year of Slippery Sounds, friends of the label contributed tracks for a dance floor ready compilation (SSVA001).  
Venturing through garage, breaks, footwork and re-works, the release does exactly what it says on the tin, providing you with some serious flavours for the dance.  
Taking its title from the labels ethos, the compilation truly reflects the Slippery.
