![image](../imported/picks-500-premieres-and-counting-1/image1248.jpeg)_We love nothing more than bringing the crew together at a time of celebration. At the back-end of last week, we celebrated our 500th premiere on Loose Lips with a special one from talented producer';_[_Omori_](https://soundcloud.com/stoyan-yovchev-omori)_';who has left us way too soon with a legacy of amazing music to dig into. You can read more about it';__[here](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/death-grips-guillotine-omori-remix-index-tapes)._It';s been an absolute pleasure to connect with so many inspirational labels and artists via this nutty selection of tracks. There really is a bit of everything in there and we encourage you to listen to [the whole 500](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/sets/loose-lips-premieres-2) non-stop without sleeping. We asked the Loose Lips crew to do exactly that and pick their favourites from the whole bunch.**Blain:';****Bluematter '; Real (LORELTD004) /';**[**more info**](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/dnb-fix-007-bluematter-real-loreltd004)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/763908382&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>"The reason I';ve picked Bluematter ‘Real” for our 500th premiere piece is plain and simple; it has seriously alluring drums and a savage, raw bassline. Oh yeah, it was also our first premiere over on the dnb fix series."

**Dave: Gaffa '; Mud Cup (SKOOP) /';**[**more info**](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/gaffa-mud-cup-skoop)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/747100372&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>"For me, Mud Cup embodies what the premiere series is all about. It';s often been a place where I';ve discovered new music, and the series is so varied so there';s something for everyone. Mud Cup is a mad break glitchy tune featuring a southern style sample. The track has been a little bit of a secret weapon '; a perfect little number to slip in the middle of a set."**Freddie: Wade Watts '; 303 Colours (DMC006)**';/';****[****more info****](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/wade-watts-303-colours-dmc006)[Loose Lips](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123 "Loose Lips")';·';[PREMIERE: Wade Watts '; 303 Colours (DMC006)](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/premiere-wade-watts-303-colours-dmc006 "PREMIERE: Wade Watts - 303 Colours (DMC006)")<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/641409768&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>

"Wade Watts is a mysterious genius and this tune has soundtracked so many wonderful Loose Lips moments, killer track."**Hardy:';****Rico Casazza '; Yaman (ARCH129)**';/';****[****more info****](https://soundcloud.com/loose-lips123/loose-lips-premiere-rico-casazza-yaman-arch129)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/294551690&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>"Despite all the great premieres Loose Lips has released recently, I';m going back to the very first ever premier for my pick. The first! Rico Casazza is a talented musician and producer who has had connections with Loose Lips over the years. This track, Yaman, was released on Archipel Musique from Canada in 2016. It';s downtempo yet lively at the same time, with a melody that gets stuck in your head."

It';s hard to find anything so original but so true to the genre: atmospheric, moody, groovy with just the right emphasis on the snare, kinda drawn back but also hitting hard. Never wanted to leave that set for a cig for fear of missing some wicked moment."

ScanOne and I also met at Threads Radio last year and since then have been collaborating on some forthcoming music which I can';t wait to share with you."

Taken from a compilation whose proceeds went to local human rights groups, whose Bandcamp description hits the nail on the head:‘The Ecuadorian scene is a producer';s scene, where audiences are not enormous, and electronic music is produced for the pleasure of producing it. In an odd way this has led to very genuine expressions';, this track is a reflection of space, in all its awesome, complex simplicity. Gorgeous."
