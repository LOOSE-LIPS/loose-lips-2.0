![image](../imported/editors-pick-trypheme-cpu-records/image1039.jpeg)_It';s rare in this day and age to experience music that is truly original '; seldom do I hear something that really manages to stimulate my senses or spark sentiments in new ways. However, after seeing French electronic artist Tryphème';s live performance in Manchester last Autumn, I was left feeling overwhelmed, amazed and itching for more. I managed to catch up with her to ask a few questions on the performance._<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3065711756/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/'></iframe>**You recently played in Manchester at the venue Yes. How did you find it?**I had a wonderful time. The promoters, the audience and the venue were very warm towards me.**Describe your musical experiences in Manchester in 3 words?**Bubbling Lava Lamp**What constitutes a Tryphème live set?';**For the live set in Manchester I used: a sound card, my computer, a Korg Radias, a controller, a MIC, egg shakers and a reverb pedal.**Tell us about the approach you take to playing live and what role improvisation takes in your sets?**There is not enough room for musical improvisation (other than voice and body improvisation) in my current set up, so I';m thinking about a more animated one… to be completely satisfied, and to fully spread this energy that I want to give, it would require me to play with musicians. It will happen at the right time.**What comes first, vocals or production?**Production always came first, and then, listening on repeat to the instrumental, I can clearly hear vocals. In my current live set up, I tried various combinations until I found an interesting story to tell, until the different pieces of the puzzle are able to communicate and come alive together.**If there was a fire in your studio and you could only save one piece of equipment, what would it be?**My external HDD maybe… but if this were to happen, I wouldn';t be sad as I would think this is fate and I will take the opportunity to change my life path.**Tell us a bit about your roots and if the places you';ve lived have affected your musical ?';**I';m from Triors, a tiny village in the south of France, where I lived until I was fifteen years old. I had a happy childhood, full of freedom; I was homeschooled, studying in the morning and spending the afternoon playing outside, living by the rhythm of the seasons, mentored by nature. I kept many sound memories from these adventures…

Something happened to me between sixteen and nineteen, that period of time before I decided to start making music, I had a voracious musical appetite and I only wanted nourishment for the heart. These songs are a part of me, as a tattoo.CLAMS CASINO '; numbABSTRACKT KEAL AGRAM '; petersbourgMEDIO MUTANTE '; another landSEBASTIEN TELLIER '; fingers of steelSALEM '; snakesJOHN MAUS '; believerFUCK BUTTONS '; surf solarANIMAL COLLECTIVE '; for reverend greenROEDELIUS '; pink, blue, amberTHE BRIAN JONESTOWN MASSACRE '; the devil may care**How would you describe your music to someone who has never heard of you?**An emotional labyrinth**Where do you get your inspirations from?';**I really need to be alone or to be surrounded by people (in a train for instance). Sometimes, I start something outside on ableton that I continue later in my home studio. Anyway, no matter where I am, there is always something which springs up and gives me inspiration: the place or the people influence what I do, changing the colours of my sounds.**In terms of creating a track, are there any particular familiarities, processes or habits you have in order to get ideas flowing?**The appetites come with eating! I like starting without knowing where I will go. I usually prefer the morning: I turn off my phone and the internet, I sip a good coffee.**We';ve been loving your ';Online Dating'; release on CPU – how did it come about? And what';s behind the release name?**I was living in Lyon and I was unemployed after many odd jobs, thus I had time off to explore the city and make music. Throughout this unencumbered time,';I welcomed many couch surfers from all over the world and they deeply inspired me.**If you could change one aspect of the electronic music industry, what would that be?**I think it';s a pity that Dj sets are often more focused on than live performances are. Also, as Fred Chichin from Rita Mitsouko said: _When it';s an emergency to make an album, it';s an emergency to not do it._
