It also features very lush psychedelic artwork by Ed Milo, which complements the overall tape design.';![](/wp-content/uploads/live/img/wysiwyg/5da487ffe91d7.jpg)The sonic melting begins with broken Braindance-y beats and warm pastoral melodies, building up acid steam to blast off to (inner)space, where it explores a synthesis of various electronic genres and returns, delivering the sonic goods.[Velum Break](https://velumbreak.bandcamp.com/) and [Woodpecking Mantis](https://woodpeckingmantis.bandcamp.com/) slowly start with gentle melodies, working up subtle craziness and twist acid squeaks in the mix, whilst flexing chopped beats '; something to which [Fxbip](https://fxbip.bandcamp.com/) contributes greatly with his doomfunk Breakcore mindfuckery.';[Nike\_Vomita](https://nikevomita.bandcamp.com/) presents an offering in a similar chopped-up mayhem terrain, however with a slew of synthetic sounds, bleeps and hits, evoking a much more relaxed and gentle atmosphere even if serving it with a seemingly colder sonic palette.[je1ku](https://je1ku.bandcamp.com/)';lands us in the chilled out ambience zone with a track that manages to be mellow even with the looped Techno breakbeat, giving it character and attitude together with the rough sound production values reminiscent of the 90s.';[Eggshell Goblin](https://eggshellgoblin.bandcamp.com/)';continues in this style with the positive atmospheres and samples served on top of rough ‘n'; phat, sliced ‘n'; diced beats, delivering a short but sweet track with a sample story backdrop.';[Danny Playamaqui](https://playamaqui.bandcamp.com/) makes the melting more intense; the melodies take a more melancholic & dramatic sound as the breaks get an increasingly more complex treatment and the dripping acid lines distort the mind.[Eazykill](https://eazykill.bandcamp.com/)';drops a heavy bass & break track, sounding quite punchy and clubby, although a bit short and cut.[Tunnel One](https://tunnelone.bandcamp.com/) mellows it a wee bit with a more experimental take on Electro / Braindance '; big bass booms and nicely whack stereo beats keep us grooving whilst synthetic and rhodesy melodies make it relaxed.Similarly,';[Gemini Archives](https://geminiarchives.com/)';have it floating with cool synthetic melodies and a more chilled beat.![](/wp-content/uploads/live/img/wysiwyg/5da486f3f3dd0.jpg)[](https://iconicblacksuit.bandcamp.com/)[Iconic Black Suit](https://iconicblacksuit.bandcamp.com/) catapults us back into funky beat territory, with Jungle rhythm explorations accompanied by a selection of 3rd ear Acid assaults done in his iconic Braindance style.[Bill Vortex](https://www.discogs.com/artist/5859349-Bill-Vortex)';continues with more synthetic junglistic mayhem, showcasing great FX manipulation skills and track funkin'; up IDM tactics.';[XoArK](https://xoark.bandcamp.com/) serves more upbeat sonic swirls with his sample-laced Breakcore that pushes the tempo and sounds sweet, but stops a bit short.[Dr. Doctor](https://soundcloud.com/dr-doctor)';melts us back into reality at the end of the compilation with a lush soulful Trip-Hop number featuring pulsating synths that sound like they gently talk to each other in analogue & binary languages.Overall, the compilation delivers an uplifting vibe and sees the varied ELM Collective going to new strengths in exploring electronic music with a Braindance legacy.
