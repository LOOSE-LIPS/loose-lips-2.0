[https://soundcloud.com/db55-1](https://soundcloud.com/db55-1)Lisbon-based artist André Trindade and his Urubu Tapes are back with another sound/visual object. The label';s 24th carefully crafted limited edition cassette comes with the sounds of Finnish artist Juha Puuperä';s Gruth project';s latest offering. A continuation and progression of the ideas explored in 2018';s [Laments](https://gruth.bandcamp.com/album/laments) for [Tormenta Electrica](https://tormentaelectrica.bandcamp.com/), _Somnum Exterreri_ consists of two long pieces composed as “tools for sleep concert DJ';s”. The album further investigates the fusion of neo-classical with elements of industrial, ritual ambient and noise music.
