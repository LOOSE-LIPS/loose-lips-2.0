**Aurora. is a brand new label from a group of like-minded artists around Europe who look to connect people through techno. The first release is a compilation that presents eight tracks from eight artists in eight different European countries, and three more volumes will follow so that eventually all 28 countries in the EU are represented.Through its releases, Aurora. will explore country '; and city '; specific techno variations. It will then make bridges between these different creative enclaves, create bonds between artists and listeners and give a voice to the more unknown and unusual scenes out there. This first compilation is a fine way to kick off and a wonderful window into new techno worlds.The UK opens things up with a track from Hesper Act, a newcomer who is inspired by astronomy. His ';Babaj66F'; is a fizzing mix of widescreen synthscapes, bubbling melodies and rhythmic ambient that takes you to an uncertain future world where tense leads and pixelated pads bring the tension. Next up is co-founder Mattia Prete from Lecce, a real visionary who also manages the Jazz-O-Tech label and the This Is Techno Jazz parties in Berlin. His ';Pidocchio'; is a cantering techno track with loopy drums getting you in the zone while slivers of metallic synths glisten like knives and bring a sense of terror.Serbia';s Nino Šebelić has been making music since just 13 years of age, so very much has his own voice and take on classic Detroit. After releases on labels like Motech and Logos he offers ';Smog';, a dark and trippy techno roller with Jeff Mills style melodies melting your mind while taught analogue drums and dark cosmic forces all race along. Then it is to Ireland for AudioAssault, Subsist and Stasis artist Fran Hartnett';s ';2000 Machines';, a blistering piece of techno with punchy drums and frazzled synths bringing real texture to the compelling groove.

Stanislav Glazov hails from Russia and has always brought a dark sense of disharmony and industrialism to his work. He does that again on ';Letters'; which is like a walk in a derelict urban landscape with frosty winds blowing hard and decaying factory sounds echoing around the mix. Greek artist Here Now There Then brings his modular synth skills to a wall of lo-fi sound, deeply buried drums and gorgeous ambient pads that cast your mind free. It';s a real journey to the fringes of space.

Spanish artist stndrd is a master of powerful emotions as proven with releases on Subsist, Jazz-o-Tech and 91 Records. His ';Placebo'; is pure techno meditation with its icy hit has and smooth, unrelenting drum loops turning you deep in on yourself as the acid lines grow ever more wild.Last of all, Argentina';s FU-5 brings his “music from the psyche” concept and love of both the synthetic and the organic to ';Intrance.'; It';s richly layered synth lines are unsettling and colourful as they swarm all around you and trap you in a celestial hall of mirrors before the pounding drums take off.This is a fantastic first offering from this label, whose bold and ambitious visions in 2020 will lead to future releases focused on precise styles of techno from club-focussed to more home-listening and meditative.

Aurora.Aurora. is a techno record label founded by a group of artists in Europe in the beginning of 2020, as sign of a love for a genre that represents, from its beginning a ritualistic form of body music. Techno music it became a cult and an ideal built from liberation and unification between people around the globe. A strong message of resistance and resilience that during the time, found new forms and new contamination, keeping an identity but evolving because of different roots of different landscapes, mentality, points of view. This futuristic genre of music brings the listener in a parallel dimension, where the repetition shows the essence of the hypnosis.In Roman mythology, Aurora was a goddess who had the power to renew herself day after day and sailed the sky to announce the arrival of the morning. She brought energy and vitality. Aurora likes new adventures, new emotions and always discovering new things and feelings.Our team of experts A&Rs and engineers are focused on the continuous research of music that fits best with the idea of the label. keeping apart every kind of judgment if not for an objective quality of the sound.  
Every release will be cataloged through different releases, giving voice, for the first time, to country';s or city';s techno scene, promoter of parties, musical style.Making connections between the techno world artists is the main purpose of this ambitious project: It helps to identify the artists in the corresponding area, in order to promote and to create bridges between them, a strong chain of talented artists that, united, create connections sharing the love for techno music. Every country, region or city has different backgrounds and influences: to make it more understandable and to analyze the direction of a city-sound, aurora. promotes, without any kind borders and musical discrimination, its best sound. An artist of a crew of artists is established in precise areas, to discover new sound and techno music.Nowadays, it';s always more difficult to identify which kind of techno a listener is hearing.Furthermore, people who are approaching for the first time in this genre are often confused by the quantity of music proposed in the industry and, most of the time, the easiest way to nominate the electronic music productions is “techno”. Just to identify some: Groovy, melodic, Detroit-oriented style, ambient, electro, will be finally cataloged to catch the attention of the people that have a preference for precise style. Aurora rises ready to renovate, redirect and to spread the best techno music from all the best techno artists around the globe.
