![image](../imported/soers-sunday-jams-l-u-c-y-summer-friends/image1130.jpeg)I';m stepping in for this feature, but thankfully it';s easy, as I';ve literally just been introduced to an absolutely perfect sunday jam. It';s from L U C Y, one of the untouchably brilliant DJ collective 6 Figure Gang (which alongside Jossy Mitsu, who contributed to our recent multi-writer article [Fantasy Realm](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/fantasy-realm), and Fauzia, one of our mass [R&S compilation](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/rs-records-in-order-to-care) review';s standouts). I know that this track will stay on repeat for me, because it';s got such a rare, perfect balance, soul and swing, it reminds me of MJ Cole';s _Sincere';_in its pure amazingness.Shout out to Loose Lips writer and ([sick](http://loose-lips.co.uk/mix-series)) DJ, CA$TLE, for introducing me to this, what he called his favourite UKG track of the decade. Which is a massive compliment, because let';s be real, UKG is the best genre of the last 30 years. Phoebe Bridgers is the best singer, UKG is the best genre, Linda McCartney sausages are the best frozen product, it';s just true.'; <iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3952104379/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=86059787/transparent=true/'></iframe>
