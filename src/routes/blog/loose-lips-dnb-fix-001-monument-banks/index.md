![image](../imported/loose-lips-dnb-fix-001-monument-banks/image960.jpeg)Given the increasing popularity of our Jungle and Hardcore Marathon events in Manchester; we're delighted to announce a new feature on the website, providing you with a regular Drum and Bass Fix. First up is Monument Banks AKA Ben Heraud.  After a slew of releases over on Melinki’s Four Corners Music, Monument Banks comes through with a liquid sensation on the Program imprint, in the form of Miya Maya.A combination of ethereal synths and a vocal yearning to break into the track, leads us into the break. We're then treated to jazz flavoured piano and soothing strings, joined later by a deep yet not out of place sub-bass to keep the track moving.This step-up onto a label like Program shows that the producer isn’t just good, he’s great. Expecting to see a lot more of him in the future.

Miya May/Coltrane's Truth is [out now on Program](https://www.ramrecords.com/download/prgram092)
