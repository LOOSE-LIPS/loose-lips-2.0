![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-kanye-west-say-you-will-ft-caroline-shaw/image1105.jpeg)Better than the original version if you ask me. So its a good job no one';s askin';.';Kanye uploaded this remix to his soundcloud in 2015 along with "will i see it" and it;s gorgeous. Yes i know some of his actions may be questionable, but he';s not well and doesn';t care what you think and neither do I xxxxx ';For me he is one of the most influential and progressive artists of our generation who consistantly reshapes music, I love every version of Kanye. Maybe I';m biased because me and my ex (Treece, hes a rapper not sure if you have heard of him) have matching Kanye tattoos, I dont know. Either way listening to Kanye was our middle ground, I';d be dancing round to clubland classics and he would just want to listen to American Football or Brand New or something (both very good bands I';m not disputing that), least to say there was a clash of desires but we could put Kanye on and all was right in the world.Yeah everyone';s entitled to their opinion but if you say Kanye is shit you don';t have a clue.\[Editor';s note: I';m also obsessed with Kanye. My favourite non-album track of his is [this';](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLpbc1N9BB8)[7 minute emo-posse cut';](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLpbc1N9BB8)outcut from MBDTF\]<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/qtnadEa5IbI?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
