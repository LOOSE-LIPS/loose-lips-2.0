![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-william-basinski-dlp-3/image737.jpeg)Taking a turn from the trends of weeks gone by I';ve chosen one of the loops from William Basinski';s Disintegration Loops. Basinski recorded the loops from clips of ambient music with the tape eventually starting to ';deteriorate and give distorted sound. Its surprising how easy it is to listen to the same loop over & over for 40 minutes but the subtle changes & deteriorations give a hypnotic progression. I hope you';ve all had a great weekend & can sink into dIp 3 like I am.
