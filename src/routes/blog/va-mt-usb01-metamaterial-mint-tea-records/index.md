![image](../imported/va-mt-usb01-metamaterial-mint-tea-records/image887.jpeg)With [_Metamateria_](https://mintteaa.bandcamp.com/album/metamaterial)_l';_(MT USB01), [Mint Tea Records](https://soundcloud.com/mint-tea-records) flies in from outer-space, bringing forth galactic sounds with a vintage feel. Packed into a spaceship-like custom USB stick, this 8-track release is an exciting display of the Bristol-based label';s vision of the future.Tracks from';[El Choop](https://soundcloud.com/el_choop)';and';[Ornamental](https://soundcloud.com/orna-mental)';initiate lift-off.';[Random Cell](https://soundcloud.com/randomcell)';s';synth stabs echo and crackle before a kick drum lumbers in, while in ';Feel Tool';,';emotive arpeggios and mechanical percussion zip around a half-time beat. The pace quickens with Oddnipp';s ';Designer Nipp';. A pulsing melody line and sumptuous pads propel the track forward, setting up';[Boulderhead](https://soundcloud.com/boulderheaduk)';s ';Ionic Bonding';';to pierce through the chug. Dub-techno pulses fuse skittering percussion and a snaking bassline, lightening the mood for the tracks to follow.Kormatsov';s ';Night Dance';';playfully mixes old and new music styles as';a retro acid line and galactic sound effects swish alongside an electro beat, while Oddnipp';s ';Oddsynth';';sounds like a house groover straight from the cassette player. Komartsov';s second, ';Acid Rain';, gives a nod to the tech-house sound of the ‘naughty noughties';, where chopped vocals and a playful bass line lead whirring bells and tinkles to delightful effect. Rounding off the proceedings in a serious fashion is Oddnipp';s third contribution, ';Groovenipp';. The melancholic synth line and rumbling bass leave a lasting effect long after they have trailed off to end the release in a contemplative manner.Suitably tripped-out music videos accompany six of the tracks, courtesy of the wonderfully named [DJ Paranoid Caveman](https://soundcloud.com/quelaanmusic) and Boulderhead to complete the package. _MT USB01_ is an innovative multi-sensory experience, with sound, sight and touch ticked off. As for taste? I guess it would be like a cup of mint tea—I';ll have what they';re having.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3084725078/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/'></iframe>_Metamaterial_ was released on July 6, 2019 on Mint Tea Records.
