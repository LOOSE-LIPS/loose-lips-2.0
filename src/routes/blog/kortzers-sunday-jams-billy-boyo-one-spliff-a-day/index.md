![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-billy-boyo-one-spliff-a-day/image807.jpeg)This weekend falls upon the date of the infamous 420 celebrations & if you';re in Manchester well be celebrating today because well, we do things differently here. I';ve chosen Billy Boyo';s "One Spliff a Day". The track is easily his most famous and he';s arguably one of the most well known child mcs to date. Little much was heard of him after the 80s & sadly Billy died in 2000. How ever your spending your bank holiday I hope you have a great time.
