![image](../imported/picks-laanis-guide-to-mosh-pit-jazz/image765.jpeg)**_Nu-Jazz has been bubbling as London';s most exciting underground movement for some time now, but it';s not easy to appreciate the energy from outside: no Spotify playlist or pseudo-academic article can capture its riotous energy.

If you dare to enter the jazz mosh pit, be warned! Any accidental damage to teeth and soft tissues is well worth it!';****Nu Jazz is pushing the boundaries in to new territories, fusing influences from Grime, Hip Hop, Reggae Dub, Bashment and Punk. Whether it';s a sweaty Steam Down session or an Ezra Collective jump up on the beach at Dimensions, here';s a list of tracks that will make lose your senses and dance up a storm. WARNING: not suitable for downstairs at Ronnie Scotts.';****Sons of Kemet '; Afrofuturism';**This band are always at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of music!

**These guys are the Rolling Stones of Jazz! With multiple sold out shows and a special invitation to play at Quincy Jones'; 85th birthday party, it';s no surprise that we were literally swinging from the altar at Church of Sound. Well and truly lost my shit! This track gets under your skin and makes you buss a leg or two!**<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/2GH4jjoDKzs?wmode=opaque'></iframe>****The Comet Is Coming '; Summon The Fire';**One of many cracking tracks by this totally off the wall trio led by front man Shabaka Hutchings. Absolutely brilliant live, bringing their futuristic electronic sound with this mysterious saxophonic intensity, you don';t know what';s hit you. I';m very fortunate to have seen them perform in Liverpool and Copenhagen';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/p2h0TkYqvoU?wmode=opaque'></iframe>**Makaya McCraven and Emma-Jean Thackray '; Too Shy

A defining moment for me personally, when Jazz crossed all boundaries and this became a Dancefloor Banger. You can play this anywhere to any crowd and you will get back all the energy the track gives.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/MN8EieT-LSw?wmode=opaque'></iframe>**Cykada '; Dimension Stepper';**A Jump up tune!
