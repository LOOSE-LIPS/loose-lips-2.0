It came out in 1992 on In Utero. The lyrics are based on Kurt Cobain';s favourite book "Perfume" by the German author Patrick Süskind. The book is set in 18th century France, about a boy born with a ridiculously heightened sense of smell and no body odor. The book touches on themes of loneliness, self-torment and the human anatomy, and obviously our Kurt loves all of that…It was also the only song on In Utero to credit all three members of the band.
