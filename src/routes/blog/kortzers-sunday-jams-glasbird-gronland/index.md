![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-glasbird-gronland/image786.jpeg)This week I've chosen what's been a recent favourite of mine, Grønland by Glåsbird. I've decided to feature the whole ep as I've really enjoyed listening to it recently as well as it being perfect for any Sunday. It was released on Whitelabrecs February 9th this year by an artist who I think is best described by their bio, "glåsbird is an anonymous side project from an established sound artist, working to create soundtracks to pre-decided themes. glåsbird will release a series of geographically inspired works as well as record for film."Grønland is a soundscape imagined upon the scenery of Greenland. Glåsbird used "Hours of documentaries, drone helicopter footage & NASA and satellite images" amongst many other things to the position where he felt synonymous with terrains. The result is a magical 6 track ep spanning over 30 minutes of hypnotic soundwaves. The ep truly has the power to make you feel as though you're somewhere completely different and in that case is a real credit to Glåsbird & to the project.
