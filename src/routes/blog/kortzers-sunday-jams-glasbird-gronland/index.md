![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-glasbird-gronland/image786.jpeg)This week I';ve chosen what';s been a recent favourite of mine, Grønland by Glåsbird. I';ve decided to feature the whole ep as I';ve really enjoyed listening to it recently as well as it being perfect for any Sunday. It was released on Whitelabrecs February 9th this year by an artist who I think is best described by their bio, "glåsbird is an anonymous side project from an established sound artist, working to create soundtracks to pre-decided themes. glåsbird will release a series of geographically inspired works as well as record for film."Grønland is a soundscape imagined upon the scenery of Greenland. Glåsbird used "Hours of documentaries, drone helicopter footage & NASA and satellite images" amongst many other things to the position where he felt synonymous with terrains. The result is a magical 6 track ep spanning over 30 minutes of hypnotic soundwaves. The ep truly has the power to make you feel as though you';re somewhere completely different and in that case is a real credit to Glåsbird & to the project.';
