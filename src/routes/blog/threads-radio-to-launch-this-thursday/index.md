THREADS!Despite being advertised as Friday, broadcasting will in fact launch on Thursday, with two special pre-launch streams, one from [the London launch party,](https://www.facebook.com/events/2033227123643313/) and [one over in Prague](https://www.facebook.com/events/231467731088831/)!!Surfing the middle grounds between esoteric bombastic musical selections and topical discussion, the station will operate two streams (Threads & Threads\*), one based at The Cause in Tottenham, and the other being built at ZK/U in Berlin.Describing their London stream, the press release states "Tottenham itself has been subject to considerable social and political change in recent years. Whilst some of this change is undeniably contentious, music and the arts are thriving. **Threads** intends to be at the forefront of this exciting cultural activity, whilst engaging with the difficult issues facing the area. The station will actively engage with the community, providing a credible broadcast platform for local people to have airspace for their unique narratives."We';ll be hosting [our London radio show](http://www.loose-lips.co.uk/radio-shows) there every Monday night, 8-10pm, with special guests ranging from killer live acts, through to unbelievable DJs, and your worst nightmares.LET';S AVE IT!![](/wp-content/uploads/live/img/wysiwyg/5c472a4b7dbac.png)
