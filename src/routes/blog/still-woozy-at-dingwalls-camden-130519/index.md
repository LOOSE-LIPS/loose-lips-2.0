M points to a swinging rounded chair on an adjacent 5th floor balcony, they';d love to have it in our flat. H '; who doesn';t live with us but is over a lot, aided by their unemployment '; suggests a hammock. H recently gifted us an embroidered faux family crest; a pair of headphones (I love music duh) encircling crossed knife and whisk (M';s vegan fry ups can solve anything). It';s a cool summer';s evening, tweeting birds and the occasional cyclist. We';re here because H is about to go travelling for a few months, and suggested we go to see Still Woozy, an unsigned Californian singer – real name Sven Gamsky – with 10s of millions of Spotify listens, whose music drapes twee guitar tones over louche funk, here with his bassist and drummer to play their first ever British gig. I';ve only heard a brief snatch of the music, but I trust H.One morning last summer I woke up from a dream, feeling woozy and blue. I';d dreamt about a conversation with my ex, a conversation that ended in their looking at me with genuine disgust, and my flying out of the window in a jet of flame and metal, destructively landing on a lamppost which emitted a series of coins like they do in Simpsons Hit and Run. I woke up '; or went up one Inception level '; and sat crying next to my younger brother, before waking up for real, alone. I phoned up H and they sympathised, before recommending that I don';t read too much into it (they know how analytic I get), that I remember that there';s a lot more randomness to our dreams'; construction than folk psychology suggests. I sat up, drank some water and went for a walk in the sun.Back to the present day. M buys a reasonably priced pre-gig pie from [Young Vegans](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Young+Vegans+Pie+Shop/@51.5413211,-0.1467597,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfd824b8d2d2e2b03?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiMu8bY6bbiAhVYUhUIHWXDD8cQ_BIwDHoECAoQCA), along with a chocolate and peanut butter pudding that tastes like God. Check them out if you';re ever in town, they sell homecooking pies as well! We sit and watch a heron walk comically slowly around us, stalking leftover food. Finally, we walk up the stairs to Dingwalls'; entrance and down into its main room.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Un5BfXOWiFo?wmode=opaque'></iframe>As the gig starts with the anthemic, vigourous _Lucy_, we';re hit by a mass scream from the audience who immediately notice its opening notes. Looking down from the elevated side section, I see a crowd of hugging couples, irrepressible grins and waving arms. After the gig I';ll immerse myself in that gorgeous sound, particularly falling for tracks like _Lava_ which allow Gamsky';s gentle, plaintiff voice to sprawl out like a sun kissed tabby cat, but here, live, the overwhelming sound is more punchy than woozy. The drummer and bassist trample and bounce around _Lava_, and the proverbial cat';s meowling is mostly drowned out by the crowd';s perfectly unified, muscular howl. Though Gamsky isn';t consistently able to deliver the records'; lilting vocal details live, the crowd do that job perfectly for him, rising and falling with _Wolfcat_';s spikes; ‘THERE';s no other PLACE we should beeeee'; and do-do-do-doooing along to those hyperchill guitar noodles. A particularly lovely moment comes in a cover of my favourite Mac Demarco song, _Still Beating_, a cover that perfectly lays out the distinct, addictive nature of Still Woozy';s sound; I write in my notes app that it sounds like D';angelo if he hadn';t masturbated till the age of 15, though when listening back to a [youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUbz6JTTOc) later that will feel unfairly off the mark. I';ll feel better about the comment when I discover that Gamsky';s favourite album is [indeed';](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMSbsp3Gdt0)D';angelo';s Voodoo).Throughout the gig there';s a jubilant to and fro between band and crowd, their energy reflected right back at them from the dancing onstage. A few of the songs don';t involve all three members, but they';re all constantly moving, dancing, cheek-kissing, enacting miniature marriages; they remind me of the dance segments in Queer Eye. After the gig finishes I wait around with H to get a photo with Gamsky, and chat to one superfan about how they got into the band (a Spotify recommendation based off Glass Animals, ‘I guess they are quite gooey';). His sister shares that ‘I feel like their music and the way they are onstage makes people feel they can be themselves';. There is something beautiful about Gamsky';s gesticulation-hive-dancing on the tracks that don';t involve his guitar, he looks the way I feel inside when properly getting _down';_in my kitchen. I ask the bassist (on the right in the photo) what his favourite track to play live, he says it';s _Habbit_. I can';t remember the exact phrasing of his response, but it was essentially ';_Habbit_, because everyone just goes crazy/gets involved/dances.';';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Zb_LxDnGxcI?wmode=opaque'></iframe>_Get Away_ by The Internet '; whose member Steve Lacy was a major inspiration for Still Woozy '; plays over the PA, and I wonder if Gamsky will follow in Lacy';s steps by getting a Britney mic, I hope so. It';s a neat moment for me as I first caught The Internet live at a similarly small venue just down the road from here. I mention this to the bassist, and he says that he feels like this will be the peak of their performance, it can';t get better even if it gets bigger, and I agree. It';s not that Still Woozy can';t get better as a live band; The Internet';s current back-and-forth between Syd';s soaring voice and Steve Lacy';s gentle drawl sounds fucking amazing. But nothing will ever touch that first gig for me, or this gig for Still Woozy fans; this was the moment that little digital numbers transmitted across the Atlantic fell aside to reveal the screaming, swaying, supporting fans underneath.
