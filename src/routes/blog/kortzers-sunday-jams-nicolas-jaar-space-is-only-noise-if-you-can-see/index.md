![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-nicolas-jaar-space-is-only-noise-if-you-can-see/image894.jpeg)This week I';ve gone for an emphatic Sunday of bass. Space Is Only Noise If You Can See is a track that hits you out of nowhere, I remember when first hearing it for the first time how it felt when that bassline pops in. The track is a spaced out feel good banger and in my eyes is suitable fitting for Sunday Jams, with its dubby echoes and delays you can almost feel time floating past you while ridding upon that trusty stead that is, that bassline. Topped of by the trippy narrative, provided Space Is Only Noise If You Can See will certainly float you through your Sunday in the best manner possible!
