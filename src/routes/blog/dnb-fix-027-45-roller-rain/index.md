![image](../imported/dnb-fix-027-45-roller-rain/image1233.jpeg)_It';s time for another DnB Fix; and this time it comes in the form of something we';ve all been hoping for; “Rain” featuring over on cult.ure this A side banger from 45 Roller definitely hits the tone this week._45 Roller is a new name on the block: but they are far from new to the industry. ';45 Roller is one of Shy FX';s alias'; which is somewhat unsurprising given the exceptional level of production across both “Rain” and the B-Side “Outrun.”Pulling me in with atmospheric thunder storms and pouring rain; something seemingly alien this week; is how we';re introduced to the plucking melody of the track; and then we hear our first glimpse of the alluring vocals of Anne Peebles; pulled from her 1974 classic “I can';t stand the rain” this coupled with a growing fanfare (a subtle nod to the original) is what really makes this tune.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFwhOqfzI3M'></iframe>This isn';t intricate, it doesn';t have mind-bending audio engineering; but what it lacks on that side of things is more than made up for by it';s charm and character; this is the song that would be slapping that smile on your face having crawled out of a sweaty tent; into the sun, full blown summer festival vibes.Just to make it even better; you can get it on Bandcamp for free [NOW](https://shyfx.bandcamp.com/album/rain-outrun)!
