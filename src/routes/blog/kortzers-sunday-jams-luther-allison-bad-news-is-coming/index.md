![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-luther-allison-bad-news-is-coming/image904.jpeg)Bad News Is Coming is one of those tracks that as soon as it starts playing and the vocals come in you think, fucking hell whats this then? As soon as Luther Allison starts singing its as if his voice starts resonating deep inside you and gives you a feeling that';s captivating, controlling and utterly sensational. Born in Arkansas Allison moved to Chicago as a young boy with his family and is where his love for the blues came from. He taught himself to play the guitar and finally got a break after much time hanging around at Chicago';s infamous blues club scene when Howlin'; Wolf, who needs no introduction invited him on stage to play. He then took over a regular spot at one of the clubs on the west side of Chicago. Heart achingly, Luther only made it to 5 days before his 58th birthday, while on tour he checked into hospital where it was found he had a tutor in his lung which had reached his brain. Luther Allison was an emphatic performer who was famed powerful charisma on stage playing extended guitar solos and playing his Gibson in the crowd. Bad News Is Coming is not only a Sunday Jam but an anthem in its own right!
