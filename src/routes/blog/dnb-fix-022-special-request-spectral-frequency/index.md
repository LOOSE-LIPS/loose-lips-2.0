![image](../imported/dnb-fix-022-special-request-spectral-frequency/image1189.jpeg)_Special Request steals the spotlight this week for the fix, no questions asked. His latest release courtesy of R&S Records sees him coming onto vinyl again with a 4 track EP that';s nothing shy of naughty!_Spectral Frequency was originally part of a free Bandcamp release, ‘Zero Fucks';, that was put out late last year although it has since been swapped out and given its own dedicated release. Although the flip side of the EP doesn';t continue with the DnB / Jungle theme, this release still deserves a mention as Spectral Frequency is simply ingenious.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvTxyFmoNVY'></iframe>The almost anxiety-inducing introduction builds the track up with nothing but a breakbeat that has been processed beyond comprehension for the first minute and thirty seconds of the track. Although however grim as it may seem, it is somehow insatiable and makes the track what it is.The rest of the track is composed of raw simplistic ‘big room'; Jungle sounds, with heavily distorted Amen breaks and deep bass sweeps; although he still manages to squeeze his signature touch into the last section with a nice arpeggiated synth that simply screams "Special Request". This is definitely one track to tear up the dance, it';s not to be played lightly.Spectral Frequency is Out Now on [Bandcamp](https://specialrequest187.bandcamp.com/album/spectral-frequency)
