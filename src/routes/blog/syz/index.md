As co-founder of multimedia collective';[Method Lab](https://soundcloud.com/method_lab), Oli Samways has been throwing dances in the basements and dark rooms of Bristol since 2015. Under his';[Syz](https://soundcloud.com/syzuk)';moniker, Oli';s singular take on intricate UK techno and unearthly bass music has seen physical release on fellow Bristol imprints';[Pressure Dome](https://pressuredome.bandcamp.com)';and';[Only Ruins](https://onlyruinsmusic.bandcamp.com/). On new project _Mindforms,';_tropical botany meets ethereal cyberspace through a fusion of styles. Primed to let the listeners'; imagination roam the digital environment, its organic drums, airy landscapes, and speckled 303 action create a natural experience in themselves. **Jack Rayner**';spoke to Oli from his current home in West Sussex.

**_Mindforms_ is mostly comprised of beat-less tunes. How do you feel the challenge of making this kind of music differs from that of club tracks?**I enjoy writing the soundscapey stuff more; you can get more immersed in it. I think most producers (myself included) who write predominantly dance music do struggle with musicality sometimes. With beat-less stuff, the textures and sound design carry that along '; I';ll gather all the textures first and then the music will build itself around that.**In your case, do the textures still come first when you';re writing club-focused stuff?**Yeah. One process that I have is to start with a few strange noise loops or little details, then the beats grow around that. There are many ways of approaching it '; sometimes I';ll just try to play chords first. I know next to nothing about theory but I know when something sounds good, so sometimes I';ll start a track that way. It';s good to switch it up, I think.**Was the combination of organic and digital textures on';_Mindforms';_something that you aimed for deliberately, or did it just end up that way?**These tracks stemmed from when I was at uni. I had two modules that overlapped '; one where I made a body of work that fell under a single concept, and another concerned with immersive environments, which involved composing for a 5.1 surround sound rig. I';m interested in ecology, weird myths and realms, and AI, and I';d just done a load of research about the combination of the three and how people think humans and AI will merge at some point. That';s where the concept for _Mindforms';_came from '; the idea of merging machines with biology. When I started gathering materials for this project, I was sampling YouTube videos of orcas, hippos, glaciers cracking… That';s where a lot of the material came from: this idea of gathering sounds from the natural world through a computer. A lot of inspiration came from';[Ray Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil), a futurist who thinks that humans will merge with AI at some point. That was the basis of this whole idea.**So you';re looking forward to becoming half-robot?**Oh yeah mate, for sure. I';ll become half a 303.**Sounds ideal.**All these concepts are quite far out, but it';s really interesting.**On your recent mix for Pressure Dome, you played some field recordings from a trip to Sri Lanka. Have you included your own recordings on';_Mindforms';_as well?**Yeah, some of the beat-less tracks contain the same recordings. Those were added fairly last-minute, because that was quite a recent trip. It';s rewarding to include your own recordings, but a lot of the material still came from podcasts and YouTube.**It must be satisfying to translate your own experience into sound in that way.**Definitely. The whole idea of a soundscape is to immerse you in a different sort of space for a while, so it';s great to be able to include my own experiences in that.**The progression of the tracks on';_Mindforms';_is very coherent. Were they written in a single session?**The more soundscapey ones were made two years ago, but I never really found a home for them. There';s been maybe 20 different versions of the title track '; I try not to throw away ideas, and always attempt to make them evolve into something that finally clicks. It';s nice to finally release a track that';s morphed over a couple of years.**You';re self-releasing';_Mindforms,';_rather than putting it out on your own label Method Lab. What';s the reasoning behind that?**We';ve got other plans for Method Lab '; we';re putting together a VA release at the moment. _Mindforms';_is a bit of a passion project, so I wanted to do it all DIY. I';ve learnt a lot in the process of making it, so this has become a test run for the Method Lab release. The VA will have a track from me, a track from';[Ghostcell](https://ghostcellband.bandcamp.com/)';who does all our artwork, another from Jimmy Decent who';s the other co-founder, then perhaps a remix or another track from the extended family.**We';re living in a profoundly strange time for dance music '; how has lockdown affected your creative process?**You';ve just got to keep busy. It';s quite rare to be given this amount of free time, particularly working in hospitality and events, so I';ve been able to focus on this project and get some music out that I wouldn';t usually push to release. It';s all DIY, you know? I';m starting to build a website with a friend, and getting to grips with stuff that I just didn';t have time to before. I';ve completely switched up my creative practice, and tried to push myself into a different way of thinking.**Which artists are you particularly enjoying at the moment?**I say this every time, but Henry Greenleaf is extremely sick. I';ve got to shout out all of the Pressure Dome lot '; Yushh and Mish are coming through with some really nice stuff. There';s a lot of sick UKG coming out at the moment, and I';m loving';[Holloway](https://www.discogs.com/artist/7261350-Holloway-5)';and';[Instinct Records](https://instinctrecs.bandcamp.com/),';[Interplanetary Criminal](https://interplanetarycriminal.bandcamp.com/)…';[Pugilist](https://pugilist.bandcamp.com/),';[Realitycheck](https://soundcloud.com/realitycheck-4)';and Em + Stav as well.**Lockdown';s over, coronavirus is over, the clubs are back open, and you';ve got a headline slot at your favourite club. What are you opening with?**I';ll probably go in all guns blazing with this absolute euphoric classic belter.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RsrdANlEz8I'></iframe>**What';s next?**After this release, I';m focusing on';[Method Lab](https://soundcloud.com/method_lab)';and preparing some music for that, as well as doing some more stuff with';[Pressure Dome](https://pressuredome.bandcamp.com/). I';ve got a few more things bubbling, but nothing locked in yet.**Cheers Oli.**

In anticipation of the release we';ve premiered the first track of the EP, _1E_, an acid tinted eco-ambient piece ';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/830684320&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false'></iframe>Syz '; _Mindforms';_EP.Out 01.06.2020 on limited 12" and digital '; Pre-order: [](https://syzuk.bandcamp.com/album/mindforms)[https://syzuk.bandcamp.com/album/mindforms](https://syzuk.bandcamp.com/album/mindforms)';[](https://soundcloud.com/method_lab)[https://soundcloud.com/method\_lab](https://soundcloud.com/method_lab)
