![image](../imported/resonance-series-11-oli-johns-2/image1165.jpeg)_Welcome to the next installment of the ';Resonance Series'; -Music massively influences visual art, and vice versa. This monthly feature introduces you to musical individuals through the other art forms that they engage in, telling a personal story of their creative output and how different mediums influence each other._Since studying sound at Brighton university, Oli Johns discovered an appetite for audio in space. Using his leftfield creativity to upturn conventions surrounding dance music, simulation, digital media and audio,';Oli turned towards reproduction of physical environments, through audio, CGI or spatial sound.

Oli deliberately ekes out artificiality in his work. He deals with simulation and its inner workings, drawing from sources like redundant';apple media player graphics. His work has a feel of being situated in a timeless space.';

His focus often lies on taking a visual approach to his concepts, whether it';s how visuals can trigger audio, or how controlled sensory input can go alongside audio. The results of these experiments bear resemblance to the absurdity and fury in his filmic inspiration, like an uncomfortable Daniel Day lewis or nicholas cage losing his shit.

Oli';s practise ties visuals in with audio, and can be seen in his piece collaboration with Maddie Banwell ([](https://www.instagram.com/maddiebanwell/?hl=en)[https://www.instagram.com/maddiebanwell/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/maddiebanwell/?hl=en)) in which an algorithm plays shots in a random order with field recordings playing in a random order alongside visuals. This exposes the assumptions made by the brain between sound and other media, how any sound can align with any image and you instantly connect and make sense of what is in front of you through intuition.';';[](https://www.facebook.com/1415214863/posts/10223864314861856/?d=n)[https://www.facebook.com/1415214863/posts/10223864314861856/?d=n](https://www.facebook.com/1415214863/posts/10223864314861856/?d=n)';

Oli now';works as an editor at a film marketing company';and has new music in the works.[](https://www.instagram.com/ojgenius/)[https://www.instagram.com/ojgenius/](https://www.instagram.com/ojgenius/)[](https://soundcloud.com/networksounds)[https://soundcloud.com/networksounds](https://soundcloud.com/networksounds)
