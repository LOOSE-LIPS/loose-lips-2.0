![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-mark-pritchard-heavy-as-stone/image1029.jpeg)Feeling heavy as stone here today, boys.';I put this on and was delightfully surprised, as I forgot how much better this tune gets as it goes on. I initially wanted to dissociate and revel in my own sadness, but then, when that double time bass slaps in at around 4.20 I forgot I was even depressed and feeling a bit fat, looked at myself in the mirror, winked at myself, did a bit of a samba round my room and all was right in the world.';It';s mesmerising, I love it.

Mark Pritchard is a top fella.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/O2W2B1-0r-8?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
