Paul Blackford is back (with a tape that came out in September 2019) '; but the release date doesn';t matter. What is important is the music, and Paul Blackford';s music has a timeless quality!';

In this tape, entitled ‘_Perspectives_';, Blackford comes back to his downtempo roots. This tape, which marks his first release in a while, bears a resemblance to his 2007 release on CPU ';';‘Light Years';';which is full of short cuts, beats, and dreamy electro excursions.';

Blackford has a place on a very long table of prolific electro musicians. Through his multi-faceted approach, Blackford operates at both ends of the spectrum. Some of his tracks move at light-speed, whereas other more downtempo beats seem to float in a low gravity bubble, which is what gives this 20-minute tape such an';‘airy'; feel.';

Like other out-and-out electro producers on this planet, what I find most interesting is the producer';s logical approach to sequencing the tracks, as well as the authentic feel of the instruments used – well-thought-out drum programming, atmospheric synths and generally good production values.';

Although ‘_Perspectives_';';came out in physical cassette form, it is also available as a digital release on Blackford';s own Bandcamp page. In addition to the 2-sided, 20-minute cassette '; the digital release also features the individual stems from each of the tracks! I';ve never seen the actual stems of a track released before, so what you get here is some interesting sample material to appreciate or have a bit of fun with on your sampler, DAW, sequencer, etc. ';

_Perspectives_ was released on September 21st, 2019 as a cassette and digital release. You can still pick up a copy of the digital release on the producer';s [Bandcamp page](https://paulblackford.bandcamp.com/).';
