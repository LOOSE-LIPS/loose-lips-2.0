[](https://soundcloud.com/291out)[https://soundcloud.com/291out](https://soundcloud.com/291out)**Bosconi Home Cooked Beat**s brings together unreleased tracks from producers from Italy and elsewhere to raise money for the [Banco Alimentare Onlus Foundation](https://www.bancoalimentare.it/en).';This initiative tackles food waste and redistributes food surplus to charities helping provide meals to those in need in Italy, which are relied upon more than ever in response to this unprecedented moment of crisis.';At the heart of the compilation and the artists who have contributed is a double mission: to support those who in this moment of need still have an essential right to food, and also for these artists to be recognised by Italian social and cultural institutions, which for the most part still do not see us as entirely ‘professional'; figures.';All proceeds from sales of the compilation and individual tracks up to 31 August 2020 will be donated to the charity.
