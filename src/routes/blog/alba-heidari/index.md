**Tell us about the ARIA collective and your recent party?**

The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. All I can tell you is that it was based in East London at a secret tunnel location. My partner in crime, Manson X,';';was playing cdj, vinyls and at the same time, ';dropping bombs with the drum machine. When he was at the controls, I had to jump on the dance floor and join the awesome crowd that iwas getting bigger and bigger.

**How would you describe your approach to Djing and selecting music?**

It is incredible nowadays, technology and the internet has facilitated easy access to a lot of music, not only digital, but also with vinyl returning to popularity. A bit screwed up for the pocket, because sometimes it is impossible not to buy, yet at the same time, it allows you not to have to repeat tracks in your sessions, as well as being able to ';encourage the work of music producers. Platforms like Bandcamp, supporting the local “unknown" artist, and giving you the possibility to get out of the prevailing trend.';

A favourite artist you have seen play recently?If I have to choose just one, James NewmarchIt never ceases to amaze me, followed by Manson, that since I know him, he is undoubtedly one of my favorite DJs ever. Andromeda, my dear Anabel, Burden, Becky Stroke, Twang,7Xins … have been making the idea of staying chilled at home ';almost impossible.

Was growing up in Madrid an inspiration for your music?

In Madrid, who has influenced me have always been my friends. I have had the good fortune of meeting people who feel electronic music with the same passion as us. In my opinion, in Madrid right now there is not such a solid club culture, and here people prefer to see a local artist, who knows that he will have more empathy and more desire to make them dance, than to a head Poster that your work has become a routine. Sometimes you go to two, even three different places to meet the expectations that the weekend offers.If there was a fire in your house and you could only save one record, what would it be?
