![image](../imported/lrc003-va-vol-3-centre-of-attention/image1338.jpeg)Manchester based Left, Right & Centre are known for peddling bass music from all directions. On Friday 27th';November, the multi-faceted crew return to showcase their third and final four track label compilation.';Containing four distinctly contrasting approaches to electronic bass music, LRC003 (much like the two releases that preceded it) captures the dynamic nature of what the label aims to provide – a fresh display of UK bass flavours that provokes thought and draws attention.The first track of the EP ‘The Proposed Roads'; is by Manchester based musical enigma Peter Murch AKA Porter Brook. It';s a syncopated halftime number that makes use of the interesting sonics this artist employs throughout his productions.';Hedchef, the Melbourne based self-titled Breakbeat Cyborg comes in on track two '; a heavy 133bpm UK bass & broken techno production that makes great use of an amen in the build ups to tease the listener throughout.Track three from Alexis seems to blur the borders of electro and techno. It';a glitchy techno thumper that gets better and better the more times you lend your ears to it. ‘Who';s There?'; pulls you in and out, with the breakdown oddly emerging as the focal point of the track.The VA is rounded off with ‘Pick Up the Phone'; '; a bass led chuggy stomper from Feloneezy which would most certainly be making the rounds if the clubs were open and full of sweaty ravers.These four forward thinking tracks are brought together under the banner of Left, Right & Centre. Although this is the final instalment of their VA series, which has seen Henzo, Kessler and Hypho in collaboration, there will be more from the UK based imprint in the coming months. Label heads Connor and Wakil have confirmed a solo EP release will open up the next chapter of the Left, Right & Centre project.Release artwork by OFF → KORZ.
