![image](../undefined)_After what seems like a millennium of quality output from GLXY already, last week saw the highly anticipated release of their debut album ‘Research & Development'; on Shogun Audio._Upon hearing the news that GLXY were planning to drop their debut album, my initial thoughts were – ‘Wait, how have GLXY not released an album yet?';. A quick search of my Rekordbox shows that I own a lot of GLXY productions '; singles, remixes and EP';s but no albums. I';ve been through the same thought process with other artists that have taken the decision to wait until they';re truly ready to release a full album and it reminded me just how much time and energy is required to put together a meaningful debut LP.

Within ‘Research and Development'; GLXY have created an album that, as all good albums should, takes the listener on a journey. They have done this whilst achieving a good level of production variation in creating an album that fits into the Liquid/Deep Drum & Bass sub-genre, but touches on other influences such as garage and breakbeat.';The introductory track ‘Hypothesis'; leading into the titular ‘Research & Development'; sets the pace for the album which also features vocalists DRS, Anastasia, Ruby Wood and Steo on their own respective tracks. Tracks such as ‘Falling'; and ‘Anatomy'; are deeper and more thought provoking Drum & Bass productions whereas ‘The LP Track'; brings the tempo down and lightens the mood, allowing the GLXY boys to flex their production skills on a funky garage number that tails off into a more deep and serious piece. The track ‘She sings for me'; with DRS is as emotional and raw as you would expect a collaboration between these two entities to be. Veteran vocalist DRS always knows how to deliver on a feature and this no exception. Favourite track from this one would have to be ‘Abstraction'; with Ruby Wood – A powerful and progressive piece of Drum & Bass with a deep introspective vibe.
