![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-serge-gainsbourg-et-brigitte-bardot-bonnie-and-clyde/image1016.jpeg)You';re in Paris, and you';re red wine drunk, in bed with a lover, the sheets are sticky and stained. He sparks a cigarette, blows it in your face then probably tells you you';ve got fat legs. The man is Serge Gainsbourg.He';s absoloutely scandalous, he causes murder and I love it; once he did a reggae version of the French national anthem and there was kick offs. This French song is based on an English poem by the actual Bonnie Parker, written just a few weeks before she and Clyde barrow were shot. Gainsbourg was infatuated with his duet partner Brigette Bardot, they agreed to go on a date when she was having a difficult time during her marriage, but the date did not go well, so she asked him to write her the most beautiful love song ever heard. He wrote two, one being ';Bonnie and Clyde'; and the other ';Je T';aimeâ€¦ Mon Non Plus'; (you know, the one with the organ and the orgasm).<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Wa7wjr1NwhA?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
