![image](../imported/picks-makatons-krautrock-rhythms/image1123.jpeg)_Do you want it darker? Do you??? We';ve got Makaton, the Birmingham Techno cult legend with 22 years of unique beats under his belt in, sharing a slice of his record collection that has influenced his sound (as displayed in sizzling live sets, alongside his imprint_[_';Rodz-Konez_](https://poison.rodz-konez.co.uk/)_). We';ve gathered the tunes in';_[_this here_](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1UtmPhteO1MI3DiDek9u5N?si=3wLs6aB_QEKn1zEiUnwMAA)_';Spotify playlist too. Enjoy!_

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/QHtyuhAcPVQ?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Cluster is one of my favourite bands and _Rosa';_is timeless. Never get bored listening to this, experimental, melodic and just beautiful.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/23HfAHSKWlk?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Negativland, industrial, noise and Neu! rhythms, when I listen to this I hear 1000 other bands that have been influenced by it.';

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/3OBYefrtY5k?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I love the minimalism, Eno + Cluster the perfect collab in machine sounds.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/4kVr8_c-HJY?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Watussi from Harmonia';s first LP _Musik von Harmonia_, it';s basically Cluster and Neu! guitarist Rother together!! Cluster';s experiments and Rother';s noise guitar. Perfect.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/NnrcyHj6zrs?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Cluster again, honestly I could do 10 picks of Cluster alone. This one I like as it';s quite mournful and reflective, different vibe than other uplifting Cluster stuff. It';s like a puzzle you can';t work out.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Hls8WnUfHbY?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Could pick any Can track, they are all amazing. Liebezeit drumming is off the wall and upfront in this dictating the vibe.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/UuL2SS18zT0?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Faust !!!! I love this.. has a garage MC5 feel, rough round the edges. Tribal, hypnotic drums, noise, EVERYTHING I love in a track.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/ZzJhoAXLmjM?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Ash Ra / Tempel members, Klaus Shulze and Manuel GÃ¶ttsching in this, mellow sessions, phasing rhythms, Kosmiche bebe! It';s a trip.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/OH4oeGU_o1U?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Total gem of an LP, whole record is full of winners. Shuffling drum machines, reverbs and delayed guitars that Marr and his mum would be proud of!

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/2gS8g2sfgWM?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Kronwinkl is just full of energy, interchangeble grooves which is so typical of this genre.
