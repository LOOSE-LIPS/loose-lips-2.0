![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-shortie-no-mass-u-like-my-style-1/image913.jpeg)I can';t tell you how much I love this song! Shortie No Mass is a little known MC who first came to attention featuring on De La Soul';s Buhloone Mindstate. Unfortunately there';s only a handful of tracks that can be found online and I';m not sure if she ever recorded many more than the ones that can be found. She truly is one of the coldest MC';s I';ve listened to, male or female. Its such a shame that she never reached the heights that she so obviously deserved. The dreamy track sits into any Sunday perfectly and I hope you agree!
