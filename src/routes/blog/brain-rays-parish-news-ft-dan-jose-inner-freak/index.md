The pair have created a unique video project '; featuring the latest single by the UK-based producers and DJs- _Brain Rays_ and _Parish News_ (whose work has been supported by Annie Mac, Mixmag and Bandcamp).';_“Brain Rays had the idea after seeing the ways people were dealing with the unique circumstances brought about by the Covid-19 crisis.”';_

_![](/img/wysiwyg/5ea991e80d8c6.)__Inner Freak_ is a house track, oriented around the sounds of the midwest. It weaves deep-house synth stabs, progressively oscillating bass parts and mesmerising vocals '; encouraging listeners to “let out your inner freak.”The music video consists of footage filmed in the homes of the featured dancers '; with a cast of music-lovers from around the world. The core idea is that they transcend social isolation and partake in the familiar and often communal activity of dancing '; sharing this visceral musical experience from the isolation of their homes. Max worked with choreographer, dancer and singer-songwriter Bryony Perkins (Punchdrunk) and together have forged a unique quarantine dance routine inspired by the cultural phenomenon of “_TikTok”.';__GET FREAKY FOR THE NHS!
