![image](../imported/head-space-loose-lips-inaugural-deep-cuts-feature/image984.jpeg)**_Loose Lips have been organising parties, mixes, records, shows and articles for 5 years now, all based on a philosophy of openness. No genre policy, no covering music because we should, just honest expression. Our new monthly feature Deep Cuts brings this attitude to the page, exploring the diverse ways we listen, love and talk about music in 2019._**_**The first Deep Cuts theme (explored by each writer) is Head Space. The first Deep Cuts mix (combining music from each writers'; contribution) comes from Deep Cuts mama Will Soer, along with a helpful spotify';**[**playlist**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0waITYaBtleahAxr88N02O?si=KsLrE8x_TiaVE92PQbwLoQ)_**_.

**Haig Binnie**As the opening track to Hercules & Love Affair self-titled debut album,';_Time Will';_\[00:33 in the mix\]_';_was the track that introduced me and many others to the ever-changing group. On discovery of their music I was in a place that did not work for me, the feelings of un-belonging seemingly insurmountable. They provided me with a sound that was unrelated to anything around me, and although over time it became a part of my environment, it was never ‘of'; it. The creamy vocals and surreal synths eluding to something so nearly within ones grasp, yet hopelessly out of reach, each note climbing atop the previous ones taking you higher than you thought possible, before returning you once again to solid ground.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/gMZ4F0YirL4?wmode=opaque'></iframe>_Haig Binnie is a support worker who makes jewellery, embroidery and music in his spare time._

Being in public places is really challenging for me so I need some smooth music I can kinda sing along to and forget where I am. Mariah Carey';s new album really bangs and I listened to _giving me life_';\[05:43\]';on repeat for a while (always need something sad to get me engaged fml).Also this:<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/PfJM2YLtOXk?wmode=opaque'></iframe>[_Julia Star_](https://www.instagram.com/juliastarqueen/)_';makes';_[_intense cathartic music_](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/julia-star-in-the-ocean-i-depart)_, placing her character and identity front and centre in sharp detail._

**Rico Casazza******<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/WjTDDCiW78o?wmode=opaque'></iframe>**';**This song \[12:00\] is a special one that brings back memories of the times when I was living in Mexico. I always enjoy harmonic, melodic music, particularly sad nostalgic music (that you can hear in my music too). It';s something that has always put me into the zone. Every time I hear melodies like this my mind goes somewhere else literally. It might sound quite cheesy but it takes to another dimension!What I really love is the unharmonic tape effect that he applies in this song. Like a broken toy box melody, broken melody, it';s an effect that I apply a lot in my music writing.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/DFcdfu2hKHk?wmode=opaque'></iframe><iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/FzcbutexzKk?wmode=opaque'></iframe>

**Cycling Sugar Glider**![](https://outofbodypop.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lrg_dsc08030-1.jpeg)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/YoOiXPy6REk?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I live a semi-nomadic life; it';s been this way for over a year now. Most mornings I pack my belongings back into four bags, buckle them up to my bicycle before spending the day exploring somewhere new. The evenings are spent searching for a spot to camp, and the nights, well, they';re all mine. This may all sound slightly far-fetched, and writing it all down now, I would certainly agree with you. Besides the bizarre premise of living on a bike, the all-important product of this strange lifestyle is that I don';t have many nights out. When I do, I have plenty of time to relive them during my countless hours on the saddle. Plenty of time to deconstruct the night – to delve deeper – plenty of time to get lost once again in the music.If dance music formed my staple diet before setting off, then losing myself in the pounding rhythms of a dark Bristolian warehouse was definitely my bread and butter. Despite this now being more than a few pedal strokes behind me, it was this vibe I chased, as I rode across Munich amidst a particularly icy January night. Lured by the prospect of hearing the city';s finest techno directly from the pulsing heart of its underground venue – Blitz – I hadn';t thought twice about heading out solo too see the young gun warming up the turntables. An integral part of the local techno label, Illian Tape, Skee Mask has been blazing a unique trail over the past 5 years releasing on the Zenker Brothers'; imprint. At a time when 4/4 techno can sometimes feel stagnant, his intelligent broken beat cuts like _800AB';_\[15:44\] have been consistently blowing me away.![](https://outofbodypop.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/presentation1.jpg)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/0EnMhu8yhtg?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Closing in on the club, I was psyching myself up, listening to ‘_Cyclo_'; from his first EP whilst cycling along the empty streets. The crackling drums making way for a cavernous snare sound that punches out above a solid sub bass – refusing to let you sit still. It sounded like the work of a veteran producer, not a 19-year-old kid. Moreover, the entire EP was stacked with a cohesive flow of tracks and recorded live sessions. As I began my inevitable descent into the Skee Mask Discography wormhole, I was seriously impressed with the quality and variety of his output.I could hardly believe my luck then, when my weekend of arrival coincided with his turn to grace the turntables on home turf.Although Blitz has been dubbed by some as Munich';s answer to Berlin, I was prudent to turn up at midnight; deciding that attempting a 2PM Sunday afternoon Panorama Bar boogie would likely lead me to enter the actual museum Blitz is built into. After having my phone camera stickered, I was immediately immersed in what I came for. Swathes of light chords washed across the darkened dance floor whilst punchy kicks kept the bodies moving as the night built. I was home.![](https://outofbodypop.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lllll.jpg)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Cpqx9M_trPA?wmode=opaque'></iframe>The universal nature of dance music combined with anonymity of a dark warehouse made for a truly welcoming atmosphere for this solo dancer. This was epitomised by a particularly warming moment, when a sea of contagious smiles broke out as the dancefloor rose up in joy at the dropping of ‘_Fjorward Flex Dub_';. The upbeat toms pushing both us dancers and night onto the next level. It was a masterful display of warm up DJing, a skill so often overlooked, that expressed true versatility in record selection that guided us on to the main event – Berlin';s Answer Code Request. After a delightful unleashing of some of his heavier cuts (likely unreleased tracks from his at-that-time-unreleased album, _[Compro](https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/itlp04-skee-mask-compro)_) the night was only going to be a success.Since that night I have been slowly cycling across continents, weaving my way across Europe, central Asia, India and now looping round South East Asia. A couple of weeks ago I received a notification to ‘look back at photos'; from that day. The sounds still seemingly fresh in my mind, I duly reloaded those early EP';s and pressed play. It';s been over a year now since that night, those icy cold hours in the saddle now replaced by a searing Cambodian heat. Yet, as I make my way across the country';s arid central plains, those scatty broken beats and driving bass tones transport me back to that darkened room. That mass of excited bodies that was my night at Blitz. It will likely be a long time before I experience a night like that again, but the sensations feel so fresh as I eagerly consume each new press from the Munich artist, I';ll keep happily keep on cycling until then.[_Cycling Sugar Glider_](https://www.instagram.com/cyclingsugarglider/)_';is still on the road!

It always fills a room up with joy and pure funk and helps me escape and float to a different atmosphere. It calms me at the same time, cos the song goes on this incredible journey through the bass groove to the harmonies in the bridge, which are reminiscent of the Beach Boys. I just get completely lost in it from start to finish._Ruthanne has written hit records for Britney Spears, Professor Green, Niall Horan, and';_[_Jojo_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8LIRtPnuA8)_. She recently moved back from LA, released her debut album, and scored a number 1 single in her native Ireland_

**Jemima Presland****Music that makes me transcend my environment.**Sometimes the soggy grey of winter makes me close my eyes and think of dry, sandy places and golden light. I dip into the pockets in my memory to feel the subtle sighs of summer';s breeze and smell the heat. At these times I listen to music which carries the sun, turning the seasons fog to steam.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/lWJ6CFZZnDs?wmode=opaque'></iframe><iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/V_RqNOejC58?wmode=opaque'></iframe>The musical instrument featured in these songs is a 21 string calabash harp known as a Kora, which originates in the Mande region of West Africa. The instrument is highly symbolic; believed to derive from the Jinns (spirits) it is said to be a medium between the spirit world and the material. It was traditionally played only by ‘Jelis';, a caste who were born into a lineage of musicians and were supported by wealthy patrons. This song, ‘_Kelefaba_';, was written to be played by a Jeli on foot, who would follow his horse-mounted patron into battle which is why the rhythm is said to mimic the canter of a horse';s hooves, and the lyrics tailored to inspire bravery.The second song,_';Mali-Cuba_ \[48:20\] is by a group of artists from Cuba and features some classic components of African music including the Kora instrumentals but has a distinctive Habenera flavor (Habanera is a Cuban style originally rooted in sacrificial ceremonies, [here';](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nmiaDA1fwo)is a modern example). By acknowledging this music as a cultural artefact, a product of cultural hybridity, we can see the mixing of Afro-Diosparic, Spanish and Cuban populations along with a melting pot of other current and historical community influences. This music, viewed through this paradigm of cultural evidence, tells the tale of slavery and colonization via melody and rythm ([this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLci-NTpqo) goes into this in detail).I became familiar with Kora music by listening to [Ali Farka Toure](https://youtu.be/P4Yu0L4fVyw), Ry Coder,';[Tounami Diabate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx7hhA0Aits),';[Tinariwen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoPPMktXCEI),';[Tartit';](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DngcmeVP1cU)and';[Rokia Traoré](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdfXY3h1CHs). There was something about that sound which felt healing and stirred my soul. This music literally made me transcend my environment, it led me to SOAS University where I was lucky enough to learn the basics of Kora playing with Kadialy Koyate, a skilled Jeli from Senegal, and to learn about it';s journey from Africa to the ‘West'; from Lucy Dolan, the woman who produced Ali Farka Toure and Tounami Diabate';s albums in the 90';s.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/vZ0gvoueFnk?wmode=opaque'></iframe>During the Zimbabwean liberation struggles, rary Zimbabwean musicians were motivated to produce music that would inspire and support freedom fighters. In the 1970';s Thomas Mapfumo developed a kind of music called ‘Chimurenga';, after the Shona word meaning ‘struggle';. It conveyed the political message of millions of Zimbabweans and was an instrumental tool of communication during the civil war. This music helps me to transcend my limiting beliefs; when I listen to Mapfumo';s music I';m reminded of the power within individuals. We can contribute to making the world a much better place just by having belief and sharing our gifts.';“The bream fish plays in its river” is a lyric repeated over and over, symbolizing freedom and a life of plenty.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/1BCHfCVw2Po?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I love this song. It has given me a new perspective when I';ve felt that “life';s gone down low”. It always brings me joy and makes me dance. It has helped me to transcend my internal environment out of the down low and into a more creative state of mind.

Sung by three brothers and their Dad it brings the heat of Latin love to cold London days. It is a love song, written about a goddess of love whose kisses are spicy.“Everything';s more beautiful whenever you';re nearby”_Jemima Presland works for the [May Project](https://www.mayproject.org/)__';community gardens, and sings in a band named [Koroleko](https://www.koroleko.com/)._

Nowadays, I';ll usually do it silently, perhaps soundtracked by a welcome spontaneous jam session from some birds doing their thing and the big tree right in front of my window rustling its leaves. As for organised sounds, I have fond memories of ingesting some psilocybin alone in my apartment and blissing out to Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith';s ‘_Tides: Music for Meditation and Yoga.'; “Tides IV_” \[46:30\] in particular really did it for me that time…haha… Otherwise, there';s so much pop music that makes me feel transcendent. Lana Del Rey, for example, in addition to my own secret pop songs I wrote and sang myself .<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/aMKBKjmM5xE?wmode=opaque'></iframe>_Deadlift';s [debut EP](https://inta.bandcamp.com/album/cement-block-ep) (released under her Bonka alias) shows off the Canadian DJ/Producer';s killer rhythmic instincts, as does the gorgeous [6-8pm open air set](https://soundcloud.com/room4resistance/deadlift-room-4-resistance-about-blank-garden-12052018) she dropped at Berlin';s queerfemme party Room 4 Resistance last year._

I';ve got 10 minutes until my first shift starts, and feel a caffeinated, unsteady balance of nerves and excitement as I put my stuff away, and look down over the mostly-empty lunch tables. Of all the music that';s soundtracked my move to London, one song rises through my subconscious; I type its name and slip my headphones on. Despite its heaving bassweight, there';s something weirdly calming about _Space_, a serene, sublime clarity. It reminds me of FKA Twigs';';_[Papi Pacify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OydK91JjFOw)_, whose beats flex and and melt into each other like the Venom symbiote, or Tricky';s _[Maxinquaye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsAqIbJAHXM&list=PLiN-7mukU_REHM3Fq66pqMlPKt2gIMJdR)_, a burning record where ash and fallen branches smoulder together. These tracks stand so clearly in my mind, that this kind of abstract imagery comes naturally; when I say that';_Space';_is the view from an X-wing cockpit, I';m just describing it.Jarvis Cocker once said that the joy of lyric writing comes from awareness that you can say what you want, as no one';s listening. The structure of a band';s sound doesn';t really highlight the lyrics, high low energy sad happy etc, it';s slightly arbitrary, if anything I think it';s often closer related to things above and beyond the singer';s lyrics; fashions, cities, tonal emotions. In tracks like';_Space_,_';_the whole production is built around the attitude and words of the chorus. This is lyrical branding in both senses of the word, the track';s metallic swing expands and drops through my head, its sound carryies Dizzee';s words just as a Lamborghini carries the car maker';s name and associated sleek aesthetics.It reminds me of a Lee Scratch Perry quote: ‘I put my mind into the machine and the machine performs reality. Invisible thoughtwaves, you put them into the machine by sending them through the controls and the knobs or you jack it into the jackpanel.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/VkcBQCFp4NE?wmode=opaque'></iframe>';I';m Sorry'; he says, emphasising the ';I'; as if someone else has claimed to be more sorry than him and he';s pissed off about it. ‘You shouldn';t touch other people';s food.';';‘Ah I';m sorry, I just thought because the microwave was done-‘Yeah but you shouldn';t touch other people';s food'; he walks off with a strong, headshaking sigh, to sit at the side of the room. I heat my rice for a minute and sit down, adjusting my seat so it';s out of his view. I microwave my soup and go outside. ForFucksSake the scanner in my pocket sets off the alarm, I give it to security to hold on to, walk outside and see the spot of sunshine where I ate yesterday isn';t there FUCKS SAKE, I look right and see another at the end of the road, up against a clothes store. I walk over there.';It';s warm.';I set my bag down, put my headphones on, and play _New Grass';_\[39:18\]. I';d forgotten its name for a second, but I knew the gentle, freeflowing guitar lick I was looking for, and scrolling through the discography I see it, the obvious correct name. It';s just _right._ It swirls with soul like the bowl of blue-white memories in Harry Potter, alive but impossibly peaceful, an organism whose heart swells rather than beats.…It';s been a long time since I wrote that last bit. It';s been over a year since the Dizzee Rascal part, since I walked to a Cavendish Square Gardens on my lunch break and told Freddie my idea for a new Loose Lips feature over the phone. I remember noting thoughts about Dizzee Rascal into my phone, next to my locker, having asked my team-leader if I could go and grab some food mid-shift (we weren';t allowed our phones on us in the stockroom, where I was working). It was a pretty miserable job; harsh artificial light, hours without human contact, enormously repetitive tasks. But the people I worked alongside were lovely. It being London they came from all around the world, as do those I work with in my current job as an open top bus tour guide. They all had their own musical tastes.It never ocurred to me that we';d be publishing the first Deep Cuts article the day after the election, or that the theme would be so timely; I know a lot of us could do with some space right now. A few months ago there was some discussion in the electronic music community about the issue with chillout music, how it can placate you, remove the rightious fire from your belly. I';m not worried that this mix will do that, because '; like all the forthcoming Deep Cuts articles '; it';s fuelled by that special spice of life, variety. The transcendence experienced by all of these writers comes from empathy, empathy with people they have never met. I hope we can focus on that._Alongside editing and writing for Loose Lips, Will Soer maintains a blog and radio show named [Out Of Body Pop](http://outofbodypop.wordpress.com), covering music that';s accessible but zoney._
