![image](../imported/dale-cornish-sim-hutchins-decoupleseries-ooh-012/image780.jpeg)Like a magic wand, this two-track 12” split EP of far-out blissful tenderness shows that UK producers are still churning out top-quality Ambient.';The first track on _decouple \]\[ series_ comes from the Croydon master of obliqueness,';[Dale Cornish](https://dalecornish.bandcamp.com/), with his track ';California';. On first impression,';you might think is the start of a donk track with the sub-tone panned out, the kick drum spread flat, until… ';you hear it is being used more and more in the outlying areas of a hypnotic realm.Gouging out a 4/4 to a 16/16 beat with sporadic, reverbing claps, well-timed rests and misinterpretable vocal samples,';Dale Cornish';has his finger firmly attached to the pulse; however, it is here that Dale takes you to that place where electronic beauty abides. After circling your head and playing with your senses, this is a 9:15 minute electrocutioner ride of how to work the emotion and motion of a drum machine and has all the relevance of the term of “Sit the fuck down — listen and dance”.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3860486165/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2050399323/transparent=true/'></iframe>  
On side B of this glorious limited 300 + download release, [Sim Hutchins](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/simhutchins) has us looking into a summer sunset. If listening with eyes closed, it is easy to be transported to a cosmic dreamscape — a sunset glory hole of Electronica with its dreamy, algorithmic, synthed-out and bass-fueled tonic.';No messing about here, _';__Druk Pak';';_is a landscape swathed in blissful tones.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3860486165/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=4087099158/transparent=true/'></iframe>The guys at';[OOH-sounds](https://ooh-sounds.bandcamp.com) label have picked out a transatlantic duo from the UK to add to their promised package of six releases comprising select works from a selection of über Ambient producers. Undoubtedly, both Sim Hutchins and Dale Cornish deserve to be recognised as the New Ambient heads that bring the soul to the new exciting';decouple \]\[ series. ';= 10/10.
