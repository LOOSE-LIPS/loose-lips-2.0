![image](../imported/dnb-fix-033-wetman-ride-snoop/image1291.jpeg)_This week';s DnB fix comes all the way from the other side of the pond, courtesy of Wetman, featuring on the Seattle based, Vivid Recordings. This latest release, The Wettening EP, is a five track journey of face melting, auditory opium._Comprised of bass-heavy, dubbed out beats, sprawled well across the BPM spectrum. Wetman manages to create a floaty, sub-nautical dreamscape, In which he';s the captain; piloting you through the deepest and darkest depths.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oIXb7bxue30'></iframe>Ride Snoop naturally takes place as the main focus for this review, although that';s not to say the whole release isn';t worthy of massive "big ups!". However, it does help tie-in to the Mantra we have here at DnB Fix Inc. Business lingo aside, Ride Snoop is a twisted Siren. Smashing her sweet amens around. Lulling the malleable minds of unsuspecting listeners to meet their makers. This is Jungle-Techno at it';s finest. Seductive, yet deadly.The Wettening dropped on wax and digital earlier this summer. Some hard copies are still floating around on [Red Eye](https://www.redeyerecords.co.uk/vinyl/123495-vivr06-wetman-the-wettening-) so it is well worth getting one in the bag while you can.
