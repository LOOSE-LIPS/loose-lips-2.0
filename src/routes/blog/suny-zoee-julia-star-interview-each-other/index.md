How has having that space influenced your output/music?**Suny**: I think having a space specifically built to make music really encouraged my practice, as it meant I was able to be as loud as I want and kinda made everything feel a bit more legitimate. It also helped the collaborative side of making music as I used to produce everything in my bedroom but I';ve found that could sometimes be a bit too much of an intimate space to share with someone, especially if you didn';t know them too well!! My favourite thing to do in the studio is write music during club nights, because Grow Tottenham is a club space as well as a community garden/cafe/studios. I';ve found you can really feed off the energy of the party, so nice to be able to be on the dance floor one minute, then running to the studio the next when i get a spark of inspiration!**Suny asks Zoee**: So what gave you the idea for the three of us to do an ep together, and how do you feel it all fits in with the rest of the content of your label ‘Insecure'; that the ep is released on?**Zoee**: I think after we hung out and a did a few demos it became quite evident that we were all able to bring different energy to the table – which I think is the key to any good collaboration, friendship or relationship. I think you can hear the complimentary ideas and energy coming through in the songs. We each take up a different space that clicks well with each other.**Zoee asks Julia Star**:';Is this the first time you';ve worked on a collaborative music project? How did you find that process?**Julia**:';I collaborated in the past on different projects but mainly for visuals as I trained as a Fine Artist. This is my first polished music project so I';m really proud of us for putting this together and I feel like I learned so much from it. It can be challenging to compromise but in the end we all need other people around us to fill in each other';s gaps. Nobody was born knowing everything and opening up my process to other people';s ideas is definitely something that helped me to become a better artist and a better person.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Ac7Zg1_OHlK3cCJdvH-A7pHjDB6vaG9Q2YD-xbuKkEmLKp4b8j4EIMXT0_dLzGT4y9anQzea6xh6S96GoPp-ALSCOmeheob31qrXu2BXFZNkmjxi5uGeccoSW0oOXIEY8YwGs8uf)**Julia asks Suny**:';Do you ever go outside in the rain to cry, then look out at the city and wish for it all to burn in its own sins? Just kidding what are your plans for the future, production wise? Anything you would like to experiment with, new instruments etc?**Suny**:';I feel like I';d like to be able to cry more tbh! I often get that feeling I';m about to then can never quite commit lol! But whenever I have fully cried it always feels like a great release though so ye I think we should all cry a bit more! In terms of my producing, on the track abandon with Ben Vince I used very stripped back sample based production with fairly repetitive beat then Ben recorded live saxophone on top. Having the live element kinda brought the track into its own, so looking forward Harri actually gave me some great advice, saying I should kinda follow that same process I did with Ben! Which is writing a fairly sparse beat with a catchy but kinda off melody then record live instrumentation on top. I';m currently working on a track with my friend Gwen Reed who plays upright bass in a contemporary classical orchestra.**Suny asks Julia**: How do you think the different vocal and lyrical style of each track compare to one another, and how do you feel the themes and feelings of the ep all come together in the end?**Julia**: I think Harry has the more melodic stuff and I do more of the angry bits. We all have very different styles but when we perform all together it';s so fun! The EP is about getting over somebody and I feel like we all needed to do that at that point in our life lol. The name of the EP comes from a meme that Harry posted on the Insecure Instagram page.**Julia asks Zoee**: Do you think that exploring your feelings of anger on this ep has changed the way you relate to people who hurt you? We';ve done a lot of girls chat while making the EP, do you think it helped you grow emotionally in any way?';**Zoee**: Writing songs and lyrics has always been a vehicle for me to channel my emotions – whether that';s feelings of elation, sadness, anger '; it all comes out in the songs. I think collaborating with you guys on this EP came at a time when I really needed to release a lot of sadness and hurt feelings. For me, writing and singing songs feels like a really positive way to purge what';s going on inside. I think many women can often worry that if they are angry they are by default going to be labelled hysterical, crazy, bitter or resentful – the list of gendered tropes goes on. When really it';s just as simple as ‘I';m angry and I need to vocalise this in order to release it.';
