Seldom do I listen to a new EP where all four tracks genuinely tickle my taste buds. Yan Cook';s latest release is one of these rare finds.';

The DJ and producer from Kiev, Ukraine, made _Counterclockwise_ the sixth release on his own label, _Cooked_. Here, each track has its own value, decidedly different from the other yet within a signature style of repetitive melodic patterns and thumping kick drums. For someone with such a particular sound, it';s credit to him that his EP';s keep moving forward whilst maintaining a strong dance-floor energy. This EP certainly has dancing in mind '; at the end of the day, that';s the most important aspect of a release, right?

Let';s get down to the details. The title track, _Counterclockwise_, is five and a half minutes of fast, hard hitting dance floor readiness. It';s a great example of the intuitive relationship between the various percussive elements, melodies and the kick drums typical of Yan Cook';s music. _Abstract_ is, as the name suggests, a little more on the creative side of his work. It focuses on distorted vocals on top of a thundering bass which is balanced nicely with tidy claps. _Tidal Disruption_ is minimalistic yet powerful '; this track creeps along, building and building. It feels reminiscent of ‘Trapb'; which has to be one of my all time favourite Yan Cook tracks. _Noiser_ finishes off the EP, it';s more stripped back and pumping with an eerie feel to it '; say no more. I don';t think by calling the EP ';counterclockwise'; Yan Cook is suggesting you play the record backwards '; however I haven';t tested that theory yet. And, as the title may hint, each track does have a palindromic sense to it.

Within a convoluted scene,_';_this_';_stands out as a great release. Yan Cook proves he is an artist still very much at the top of his game. Make no mistake '; _Counterclockwise_ is a serious weapon to have in your record bag.

Released 6th March 2020.
