![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-otis-redding-the-dock-of-the-bay/image770.jpeg)This week I';ve returned to Otis Redding. The Dock Of The Bay is a song that everyone knows or has at least heard! As I';ve previously said Otis was my ground zero in terms of soul and blues music and this song was the start of it all for me. The Dock Of The Bay holds a special place in my heart for a few reasons & is a track I never tire of hearing. The track was recorded twice, one recording took place a couple of days before Otis';s unfortunate & tragic death in a plane crash. I can truly say this is one of my all time favourite tracks and I hope you enjoy listening to it today as much as I am.
