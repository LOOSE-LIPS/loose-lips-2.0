![image](../imported/kevin-richard-martin-sirens-room40/image873.jpeg)I first heard [Kevin Martin](https://www.discogs.com/artist/142639-Kevin-Martin)';s (aka The Bug) music in a film. I used to be a huge cinephile, and [_The Conversation_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071360/)_';(1974)';_was_';_one of my favourite films. Coppola';s classic really touched me, and led me to The Bug';s first album [_Tapping the Conversation_](https://www.discogs.com/The-Bug-Tapping-The-Conversation/master/1120350). Being a breakbeat and hardcore hip-hop addict, together with my love for dub and noise, I found this album and artist a gift from heaven. His productions are non-apologetic and _Tapping the Conversation';_is much a better listen than the original film soundtrack, at least for me. I also got hooked on all of Kevin';s later albums, and my first vinyl by The Bug was his collaboration with the band Earth on the [_Boa/Cold_ single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfGUMBUxN4M).  
Fascinated by his career, The Bug gave me the inspiration for my [Likvidator](https://soundcloud.com/likvidatordub) moniker and the sound you hear there; however, this release is a different story, so I';ll stick to writing about that and why it stood out to me. The Bug has chosen to use his real name, Kevin Martin, for [_Sirens_](https://room40.bandcamp.com/album/sirens), an album released for the [Room40](http://room40.org) label.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3221015389/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/'></iframe>Unlike many of his other works, _Sirens_ isn';t about the technique, the rhythm, the dub; this one is about emotions and forms an expression of the turbulent birth of his first child. About that topic, with my 24 years, I don';t really have the experience to comment; however, I can truly feel how the deep feelings and moments of darkness on this album lure the listener into Martin';s world in the hospital, in his mind, in everything around.  
From ‘Bad Dream'; to ‘Alarms';, the soundscapes gradually evolve and increase in their solemnity. As the album progresses, Martin opens his thoughts and presents them to the listener (see ‘Mechanical Chatter in the I.C.U';, ‘Necrosis'; and the closing track ‘A Bright Future';)  
The delicate touch and ambient feel is what makes _Sirens_ so deep and honest, and the industrial elements of his very own productions are present in the deepest frequencies, which arise on occasion and only when called for. _Sirens_ could be considered a perfectly-executed, drone-heavy album that shares the artists'; personal experiences and challenges in the form of carefully constructed soundpieces.Kevin Richard Martin – _Sirens_ was released on Room40 on May 31st, 2019. It is available on the [Room40 Bandcamp page';](https://room40.bandcamp.com/album/sirens)on digital and vinyl.
