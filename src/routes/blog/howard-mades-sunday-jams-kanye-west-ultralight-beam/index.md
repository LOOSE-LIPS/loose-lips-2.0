![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-kanye-west-ultralight-beam/image1114.jpeg)So I know I did a Kanye tune [last week](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/howard-mades-sunday-jams-kanye-west-say-you-will-ft-caroline-shaw) but I don';t care, this is a pivotal change in my life. This week I discovered the [Wim Hoff](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/practice-the-method) breathing technique.I';d heard about it before off friends but just told them they were nuts and I thought cold showers were just a bizzare form of self harm. But ohhhhhhh my days, I was so wrong. I did the breathing excerise following one of his youtube tutorials, psyched myself up a bit more, did the horse stance, jogged on the spot, did some star jumps, shouted at my own reflection and hopped in the shower. UNREAL.';Every fibre of my being was absolutely on one, never felt so good, literal super saiyan, then I just listened to kanye b2b kanye, my power growing stronger by each album. When I got to Ultralight Beam I was a formidable force (or at least I thought I was until I came down from my power trip after writing in my diary), we all know it';s an unbelievable song, but combined with Wim Hoff breathing it';s just adhfiulshuaiewgukjfhkaebauhdciqh';What I';m trying to say is Wim Hoff + listening to Kanye West = the ability to do anything.I may be deluded but who cares, if it works for ya, do it.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/6oHdAA3AqnE?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
