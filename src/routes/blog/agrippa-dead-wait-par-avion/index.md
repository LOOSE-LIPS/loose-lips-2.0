![image](../imported/agrippa-dead-wait-par-avion/image876.jpeg)[Agrippa](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/agrippa)';s _Dead Wait EP_ came out on May 31st on the UK-based producer';s own label [Par Avion](https://paravionrecordings.bandcamp.com). Over the four tracks, Agrippa continues with a sound he has crafted carefully through his previous releases. Filled with intricate, rolling percussion, broken beats and cerebral samples, with his latest EP, Agrippa takes things to a slightly darker sub-level. Like 2018';s _Migraine Urgraine_, his previous release on [Version](https://version111a.bandcamp.com/), broken techno and wonky bass form the order of the day here.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1017290302/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/'></iframe>In the inviting opener, ‘Squid Girls';, a midnight stepper, samples, congas and shakers join forces in a light workout that forms an invitation to the EP';s inner ring. After that early dance, the title track, ‘Dead Wait';, breaks into a gallop, straight out of the gates. A bit of a stomper, a bit of a mover, the bass adds to the pressure. ‘Spice Raiders'; comes up next on the B-side. Restless outside the 24hr supermarket, this one shows off a scattier side to Will Hart';s productions — glitches and flashes bog the mind, distracted by grimy synths and the sample of a night owl cooing in the trees of the car park. Somehow finding a parking space, ';Scabs'; shuts off the suped-up engine with a real late-night creeper of a track. A skulking groove is backed up by a gang of blips that orbit the beat';s axis to the end.';_Agrippa ';';__Dead Wait EP_ was released on Par Avion on May 31st. The 4-track EP is available on both vinyl and digital at the [Par Avion Bandcamp](https://paravionrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/dead-wait-ep) page.';
