What follows is an interdisciplinary exploration of the various moods and sub-genres of minimal house.';With the sonic glitches and breakbeats of _Under Control,';_the dubby and stripped back style of _Hypercolour_, and the late night, deep grooves of _Wasting Time';_ '; Devv';s debut album is a showcase of his protean versatility as a producer.“_Make music for yourself. If you';re lucky and people end up enjoying what you do, that';s just a bonus._” '; Devv (read more from his recent [SOLVDMAG](https://solvdmag.com/101-with-devv?fbclid=IwAR24qq_eNH8KyukIOic99d0zRwlHvtPsz9G6xJu2ZYNR3ByeTwFntygS__4) interview here). ';What I like most about this album, is how it transcends the traditional notions of club-oriented minimal. The instances of melody, ambience and atmosphere mean this release has as much impact for the home listener as it does on a dance-floor (making it perfect for times like these).';From the expansive and mind-bending breaks of _Alternate Reality,_ to the etherial and downtempo _Flow ';';_Devv takes listeners on a journey of differing moods, motifs and compositional themes. Within this there is a cohesive warmth underlying the entire album and reinforcing Devv';s signature approach to composition.';Definitely one to check out.';Tracklist:';
