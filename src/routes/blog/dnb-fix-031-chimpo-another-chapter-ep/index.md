![image](../imported/dnb-fix-031-chimpo-another-chapter-ep/image1273.jpeg)_Are you ready? Hands up. There';s no intro. There';s no easing in. If you';re looking for an ‘(Interlude)'; hallway through to calm you down, it isn';t here. Chimpo steps up to the plate in this week';s DnB Fix; with his new release "Another Chapter" over on Box N Lock._Another Chapter is pure Sicko Mode Chimpo (Drake feature not included). It';s twenty minutes of blistering, in-your-face energy. There';s rave stabs straight out of the 90s, raw grime squares from the noughties, there';s even some [familiar sounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAbkBLKisIg) bass pattern chopping on _Cantankerous Business_, but it';s this very combination of familiar sounds used in a much more hectic form which makes these bangers so much more fun, in that very Chimpo style.';

The songwriting is razor-sharp with every track setting a mood, getting into it and stopping before the intensity gets tiresome, plus the title track wraps up the whole rollercoaster on a lovely, uplifting note so you walk over to the smoking area skanking rather than punching walls.';It';s not a sonic revelation, but there are no weak tracks either. That all killer no filler approach already makes it one of my favourite EPs of the year. Here';s to blasting these out on club sound systems in 2030.You can grab the release over on the [Box N Lock Bandcamp](https://boxnlock.bandcamp.com/album/chimpo-another-chapter-ep) now!
