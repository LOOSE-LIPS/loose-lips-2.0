![image](../imported/picks-train-journey-music/image754.jpeg)Each time we host a guest selector for our Picks series, we ask them to pick a theme, but this guest comes with one already part of the conceptual package. Born out of the functionality of ‘an extensive multi-genre music playlist to sweeten the commute';, Train Journey Music is a gorgeously modern example of music creation, hosting intimate club events that bring their aesthetic to the next level. Their next journey [gears up on Saturday the 16th](https://www.facebook.com/events/546763755791292/) for those who wish to travel with them, in the meantime here are a few selections from the residents!

Deadbeats '; Made In The ShadeEven during the early days of Train Journey, Mark Farina has found a way on to our playlists through compilations such as Mushroom Jazz, Downtempo Garden and Fabric 40. Seeing Mark play with legends DJ Sneak + Derrick Carter back in 2013 was certainly a highlight for that year.This Deadbeats track was discovered listening eclectic selections from ';Mushroom Jazz 2';. Definitely check Mushroom Jazz and his other mix series ';Downtempo Forest'; for those long journeys as it';s a particular sound we always want to include within our music. Nottingham';s Deadbeats though are gods of UK lounge music with collaborations with the likes of Simon Lovechild, Nightmares on Wax and Aim.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/4soMmzNj8-0?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Felix K '; Flower Of HopeThis tune takes us back to our first residency on a radio station based in Nottingham. It';s got a real eerie ambience that sets the mood. Felix K brings the perfect blend between Ambient, Techno and Jungle.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/dBC7gMBuFWc?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Shigeto '; Detroit Part 1Shigeto is a favourite of ours from Ghostly International, with his tracks regularly featuring in our playlists as well as mixes. His music blends all of our tastes together with a mix of jazz, hip hop and electronic music elements all making up his unique sound. We';d highly recommend checking out his live show, it was a musical highlight of ours in 2018. This track in particular is a good one to pick things up.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/aG6Z_-iE4lI?wmode=opaque'></iframe>dBRm '; third roomThis one ties into the roots of our main tastes with the artists involved with this dBridge and Radioactiveman collab on The Nothing Special. A spacey techno roller of sorts with real musicality with it';s orchestral elements.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Wcweltq9Nf0?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Up High Collective '; EmtioAmbient selection is really important for us whenever we think about what to play next. This one';s a tension builder that reminds us of old skam records, Boards of Canada and Jega cuts from the mid-90s '; but reinterpreted for today -which is a good way to describe part of our core sound.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/jn0q2Mul3RE?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Juj '; Space GoldOne of the stand out tunes from our set in Japan."Konnichiwa" to the locals in Ito.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/YAW0CGuv_4Q?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Skee Mask '; Rev8617When it comes to breaks and some dreamy techno cuts Skee Mask is your guy. This one is 3 minutes and 44 seconds of just that.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/hSa-0vzTBmA?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Quasimoto '; Catchin'; The VibeWe';ve got a lot of appreciation for Stones Throw artist Jeff Jank who created the look for Madlib';s alter ego. It really reminds us about how important it is for music to be visual. This is a cut from one of the more underrated LPs. It';s just a playful trip through the mind of Madlib and the instrumental is an undeniable bopper so it';s going in.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/TVbrpJ13emo?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Moomin '; You Neva KnowMoomin is an unsung hero when it comes to our House collections, with the kicks in this track giving you no choice but to move.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/O2gCjsFFJfw?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Beat Spacek '; Alone In Da SunTune picked from the competition for our first Train Journey Music event at Five Miles.Was the last track of the night that signified the good vibes.**<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/YZlKhsSY3Xk?wmode=opaque'></iframe>**
