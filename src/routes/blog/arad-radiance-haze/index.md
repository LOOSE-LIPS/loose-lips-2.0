Dara Smith, one half of the successful duo Lakker, continues to reinvent himself through his solo moniker ARAD. ';ARAD is not only an exploration of new sounds, but also an exploration of persona: physically and virtually. Through ARAD, Smith is allowing his many-tendriled mind to investigate all aspects of media, technology and scientific interests, which his curious mind constantly delves into. Physically, he has challenged himself to become a performer by providing the vocals to his music and singing live during performances. Virtually, he wants to use his love of visual mediums to ‘live'; through ARAD on as many interesting virtual planes as possible. ';This fluid persona allows Smith the opportunity to work beyond the realms of an electronic musician, spreading his wings into performance art, virtual art, etcHis solo journey started with a pair of releases on Speedy J';s legendary label Electric Deluxe, then on the influential Bedoiun Records, where Smith truly found his new voice. Now with this Fourth release, ARAD has found a comfortable home with the daring tastemaker label Voitax. This latest EP combines processed vocals with colorful synthesis and a nostalgic nod to Uk Garage. Smith explains, “I really enjoyed experimenting with beats that had some swing to them but also little darkness”. ARAD continues his vocal explorations on this EP, but as always there are cross-genre tracks that defy categorization. ARAD is also comfortable making pure dancefloor music but what binds all of the work however, is the attempt to capture emotion and colour in music. This synesthetic approach is what makes ARAD one to watch!

"Barometric Shuffle" doesn';t waste time in getting things going. Sub-heavy low ends are met with apocalyptic pads and spoken words, while the track shuffles forward atop some tough, broken beats."Flux States" flaunts its UK garage inspired drum work, while Arad gives the EP the first glimpse of his haunting capabilities as a singer."Barn Gate" presents itself as a functional, dance floor friendly slice. The drums'; groove and rhythm propel the track forward, while the bleeps and pads keep things warm throughout."Squidger" and its playful synths, as well as heavy-duty percussion, make this one a versatile number with an emphasis on functionality."Vortex" marks a shift in tone, as uplifting synth work is traded in for brutality. Rowdy bass hits are glued together with brief slices of break chops, as the producer';s vocals lead the track gracefully to a smooth, impassioned ending, juxtaposing itself to the track';s inaugural mood.The titular track "Radiance Haze" acts as the outro for the EP. An ambient track soaked in atmosphere and transcendence. A fitting end to an emotionally charged release.Release Date: June 8th, 2020
