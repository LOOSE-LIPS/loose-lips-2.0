![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-my-chemical-romance-mama/image1006.jpeg)Seeing as their new tour has just been announced and I';m fucking elated. You can all have a bowl of this, I will literally fight you if you say they';re not a good band.';Anyone who does a polka-esque tune about a solider at war writing letters to his mother who is ashamed of him, featuring a verse from the offspring of Judy Garland is more than worthy of a Howard Made Sunday jam.They';re camp, dynamic, theatrical and their harmonies could give the beach boys a run for their money. They were just so ahead of their emo peers at the time, taking the sound to a whole another level; whilst the rest of them were playing power cords sporting shit fringes (alas, it was a different time) MCR were creating a caberet concept album. Gerard Way is a general creative powerhouse, if you haven';t already go check out his comic which has now been turned into a netflix series "the umbrella acadamy".';Also Liza Minelli spontaneously added the crying at the end herself.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/GEvLye15sq0?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
