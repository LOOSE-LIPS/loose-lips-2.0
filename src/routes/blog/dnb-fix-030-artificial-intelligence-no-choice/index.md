![image](../imported/dnb-fix-030-artificial-intelligence-no-choice/image1264.jpeg)_Yep, it';s that time of the week again, and this DnB Fix is a new liquidy one from the legends that are Artificial Intelligence, with their new EP "Signs" on Metalheadz._Hailing from North London, Artificial Intelligence are nothing short of a Drum & Bass staple; their tunes have graced many a record bag over the years, covering the whole spectrum; it';s pretty unsurprising that the duo is back once again, with another seriously good release; this time on Goldie';s Metalheadz imprint.This weeks track in question is “No Choice” and the one collaboration on the EP. ';A.I have worked alongside Rotterdam based Satl this time around to create a choral liquid masterpiece.

A ghostly chorus starts off the track, drawing you into the precise break. ';Drums so perfectly crafted there';s no need to fill it out with much more, utter sonic mastery at play right here. ';It is at this point we';re joined by some incredible female vocals, and pulling it all together the naughty melody (and maybe the occasional flourish)The rest of the release is equally exceptional, “Outer Origins” and “Intrepidity” are both on the darker, steppier side of things; with “Good things” and “Signs Signs” sticking to the faithful liquid sound.Grab it now at all major platforms!
