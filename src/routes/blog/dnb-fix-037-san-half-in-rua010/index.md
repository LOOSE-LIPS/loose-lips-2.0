![image](../imported/dnb-fix-037-san-half-in-rua010/image1333.jpeg)_This week';s DnB Fix has gone a bit off key; with our own Morgan stepping away from the vinyl only “proper Jungle" selects that usually grasp his attention, and into the proverbial dark side with a release on Rua Sound from the enigmatic San._Bristol based producer San';s (who at this point; is nothing short of a mystery, other than it';s an alias from an already established Techno artist) "The Subject 9 EP" arguably falls under the pretence of Future Jungle / Tech-step DnB, which would normally get left to the other members of the team. Nevertheless, this isn';t to say the release lacks the raw vibe and spirit of the old-skool. Hence why Morgan felt it deserves a big, BIG, shout out.';Half In presents itself with the mannerisms of a late 90';s Source Direct tune, with production skills that rival Sully and electrifying breakbeat edits that would hold themselves against the likes of Photek.';

Menacing, grainy and foreboding, San really pulls this track together with perfect decorum. Seamlessly merging the trepidatious atmosphere with exceptionally tight-knit drum cuts that have been meticulously calculated down to a T.';With an absolutely timeless feel, this EP seems like a perfect nod to the pioneers and producers of an age when Drum and Bass gained it';s traction and begun laying down those initial foundations. A pivotal point for the genre in which it would fly the proverbial nest that branded it merely as a sub-genre of Jungle, finding it';s wings for what would become one of the biggest dance music genres of the last 20 years.';The Subject 9 EP released late last week and is available in digital and vinyl formats on the [Rua Sound';s Bandcamp](https://ruasound.bandcamp.com/album/subject-9-ep).
