![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-gangsta-pat-i-wanna-smoke/image847.jpeg)This week is Memphis-inspired and comes from none other than Gangsta Pat! Gangsta Pat isn';t the first name that comes to mind when you think of a Sunday Jam but let me assure you they don';t get much better than this. Pat Hall hails from Memphis and gained notoriety mainly in the 90s, he';s now 45. It';s worth noting that on his earlier albums Pat not only wrote the tracks but also played all the instruments, as well as producing them. Crack out your Swisher Sweets & settle down with Gangsta Pat for a serious Sunday Jam.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/tusvYINkqoE?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
