If you';ve heard anything that DRS has put out ever, you';ll know that he is no stranger to laying down a verse on this type of fun and energetic Drum & Bass beat. His flow and bars fit the track seamlessly and the vocals go hand in hand with Chimpo';s production.It';s also great to see Slay jumping on the 174 tip once again. Having grown up in Manchester and making a name for himself in the UK Grime scene alongside local pioneers such as Shifty, Liquid, Wrigley and more – Slay made the crossover and started spitting on Drum & Bass beats in 2018 when he first teamed up with DRS, Chimpo and Ragoloco on ‘No Trust'; (Also released on Box ‘n'; Lock).Another 5-star beat and witty verse from Chimpo rounds off the tune as a certified summer sizzler that we';re eagerly looking forward to listening to on a beach in Croatia or through a heavy system in a sweaty basement in South Manchester.“Hurt Someone” is available now on [Bandcamp](https://boxnlock.bandcamp.com/) and [Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/track/hurt-someone-original-mix/13033303)[](https://twitter.com/CHIMPOMCR)[https://twitter.com/CHIMPOMCR](https://twitter.com/CHIMPOMCR)[](https://www.instagram.com/delrokski)[https://www.instagram.com/delrokski](https://www.instagram.com/delrokski)[](https://www.instagram.com/manlikeslay)[https://www.instagram.com/manlikeslay](https://www.instagram.com/manlikeslay)
