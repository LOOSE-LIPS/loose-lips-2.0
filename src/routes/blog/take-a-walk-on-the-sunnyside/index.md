![image](../imported/take-a-walk-on-the-sunnyside/image850.jpeg)I have spent the past five or so months walking along the icy shores of Lake Ontario, eagerly awaiting summer';s arrival. Even in these colder months, I always recommend to visitors of Toronto that they enjoy a southbound amble through High Park to Sunnyside Beach. With the Loose Lips family recently here; I had the pleasure of taking Kortzer and Medallion Man on this delightful stroll. There were detours to see the park';s famous Sakura blossoms, buy hotdogs and visit the zoo.';For a large part of the year, Sunnyside Beach is battered by bitter chills from the frozen lake';s winter winds. For just a few magic months; this West-Toronto gem becomes a paradise of leafy shade, cooling lake breeze and world-class musical curation. The Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion dates back to 1922; it is a beautiful venue defined as much by its idyllic natural surroundings as its historic significance in Toronto.';This picturesque location has become the home of the brainchild of Richard Brooks ';';[Captive Audience](https://www.facebook.com/mycaptiveaudience/). With a career spanning over two decades; the Toronto house music stalwart started the project aiming to';[“produce some top shelf music events that stimulate the mind, body and soul.”](https://torontoguardian.com/2016/05/richard-brooks-20-years/)';With this ambition in mind, it is safe to say that this event was successful in achieving its goal.';

Throughout the day;';[Adrian Ravelo](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/adrianravelo),';[Korea Town Acid](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/koreatownacid),';[Basic Soul Unit](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/basicsoulunit)';and';[Move D](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/moved)';produced genre-spanning performances. Before sundown, the music dipped between deep house, more melodic house, techno, disco and even some dub-techno influenced numbers. ';The weather was uncharacteristically overcast and chilly for the time of year; ';somewhat dampening our spirits upon arrival; However, the nuanced selection of the performers soon got us dancing and we quickly forgot all about the cold.';As the sun went down and the full moon rose; Move D took a musical tangent from the preceding deep house and disco. The overall feel went from summery festival music to more club-oriented dance music. Flawlessly he weaved between house, techno, breakbeats, garage and even closed with some dub tracks. This was the second time I have seen Move D play at sunset; having also been blown away by his performance at Houghton Festival in 2017. To me, what characterises him most as a DJ is his true calibre as a selector; able to capture moods and play to his audience and surrounding environment.

The season opener set the bar very high for Captive Audience';s summer programme. The following party hosted';[Wajeed, ALi Black, Stacey Sexton, and Devv](https://www.facebook.com/events/2264421843825865/). Today';[Steve Lawler](https://www.facebook.com/events/648485958929979/)';headlines the party; with support from Arman & Beynon. [Derrick Carter](https://www.facebook.com/events/488104548598863/) then graces Sunnyside with his presence on the final weekend of June, alongside Richard Brooks, Sean Roman, Miz Megs and Strange City & Tele.';With all the musical talent showcased in just the month of June, I am eagerly awaiting the line-ups for July and beyond. It is safe to say that this is one of my favourite parties to attend anywhere in the world. Whether you are a local or a tourist in Toronto, I would highly recommend you visit and see Sunnyside for yourself.';
