She told me my resentment';s getting smaller';My favourite artist of the last 3 years has just dropped her first solo track in, well, 3 years.';Three years since her debut album was released, three years during which she';s become fucking huge despite making such INTENSELY dark songs, songs that stare mental health and mental pain right in the eye, that inspire genuine cult-like worship in fans across the world.';I love pretty much everything she does, but I particularly love Garden Song for its pace. It';s so similar to the last album in some ways, but the the riff has so much more bounce than anything she';s done before, whilst the lyrics roll through situations and scenarios and tenses. Reminds me of the new Aldous Harding album a bit (another astonishingly creative songwriter).The last line, â€˜I get everything I want, I have everything I wanted'; tells me that this whole song is about her current life, taking a moment to think about how everything is changing and intensifying, it';s not all bad (laced with hope fear excitement and dread), it';s just a lottt. No wonder the video opens with a bong rip.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/1u8rIx65QgA?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
