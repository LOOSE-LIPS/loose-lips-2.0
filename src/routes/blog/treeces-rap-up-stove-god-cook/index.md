_';‘I just sold a brick out the church parking lot hallelujah';_

Although I love the name, pre-quarantine I couldn';t tell you who Stove God Cook$ was. Being a big rap fan, it was hard not to notice Busta Rhymes acting extra active on Instagram, promoting the roster of his new label The Conglomerate Entertainment. Busta is a man who has always had his ear to the ground, not just in the 90s but post golden era too. Notably; his work with J Dilla, being present in the studio during the writing of the game changer ‘A Milli'; and later his close ties with OT Genesis & Westside Gunn amongst others. This means if it has Busta';s backing, its most likely gonna bang.

_';‘Umbrellas out, it';s raining cats and dogs in bricks, dancing in these money puddles, we rich';';_'; (Stove God Cook$ '; Money Puddles)

Hailing from the city of Syracuse in North New York State, Stove presents East Coast street rap at its finest, therefore it';s only fitting that the OG Roc Marciano is on production duties for the entire project. The intro track slaps like an early noughties banger, packed to the brim with horns and ODB references as well as showing off Stoves'; rhyme styles and New York drawl. The real introduction to Stove God however comes on track 2 '; ‘Bread of Life'; where you can hear him wailing; ‘_I just sold a brick out the church parking lot hallelujah';_, a punchline delivered with passion, irony and swagger next to none. At this point your ears are really starting to pick up on his pen game;_';‘Theres always going to be one Solange in the elevator.';_ This is effortless rap at its best, on ';Crosses'; you hear stand out quotes such as _‘My daughter wears chinchilla to the petting zoo';';_and _‘I could sell a brick of rain in a tsunami';_, jeez.';

Throughout ‘Reasonable Drought'; (a nod to one of NY';s kings Jay Z), Stove easily switches between relentless hardcore rap flows and his unique singing styles '; unlike any of the current auto tune trending rappers. This is what really makes his character stand out throughout the project. It sounds like Stove is rapping to the Pyrex and the crack rock, he says it himself on ‘Burt & State';; _‘I should be beyond all this Stove shit I be on, when I hit the kitchen I feel like Celine Dion.';_ No more words needed.';

Stove';s style is married perfectly to the minimal, stripped back and smoked out productions of Roc Marciano; a long time collaborator with The Alchemist. You can really hear ‘Al';s'; influence on the production throughout, with the pitched up vocals and sample chops but credit where credits due, Roc has done his digging here. The instrumentals create the perfect foundation stone for Stove, with Roc often letting the samples breath and speak for themselves, rarely layering drums, a sound that';s become synonymous with Buffalo and NY street rap as a whole.

A must listen for any rap and music fans across the board, something refreshing while still being universal with the sound, this one for the new heads and the old. As Busta said himself, _‘it';s indescribable to put in to words, the performance level (Stove) has put in to this display of work.';';_Bottom line is go support Stove God Cook$ purchase his debut album '; ‘Reasonable Drought';. Judging by how assured he sounds here, there';s going to be a lot more to come from him.
