![image](../imported/brain-rays-queer-essentials-2/image1334.jpeg)**_Hello to the Loose Lipped massive! Today we have a tuneblast from Brain Rays, an intriguing Devon-generated gentlemen who just does whatever he wants really; high bpm beaters, scintillating soundtracks (including Rhys Chapman';s debut film Wonderkid), crew found-ings (Wrong Music and Bizarre Rituals) and radio shows (_**_[**Die Curious';**](https://www.mixcloud.com/ThreadsRadio/die-curious-w-glysk-brain-rays-17-sep-20/)**on Threads). Packing that into one sentence wasn';t easy, but ye what a guy, and moreover he';s doing something that I love to see in this article; there are many forces at play in the scene which erase the tensions which inspire its , so shout out to Mr Rays for countering this. The tunes are gathered in';**[**this****';**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/21R5Jeo047WZUZbi2yRk1e?si=kjni8x00Q_OQDQmeW1EiEA)_**_Spotify playlist, take it away…';_**Sadly no part of the world is free from racism, sexism and homophobia. The electronic dance music scene is rooted in the struggles but also the solidarity of the LGBTQ+ community. This is often forgotten about and queer representation in dance music is still depressingly meagre. Here are some of my favourite tracks. They are all by queer artists/producers.

Avtomat is part of a queer Polish music scene that are railing against a brutally homophobic government and police force. This amazing voguing track is from Total Solidarity, a charity compilation released with @oramicspl in cooperation with @psychicwarfare and Berlin';s Uferlos Studios. “Proceeds from the compilation go straight to LGBTQ organisations in smaller Polish cities, where homophobia, biphobia and transphobia are the hardest to endure”.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/dVExpCA_H3A?wmode=opaque'></iframe>This one reminds me of Bizarre Rituals crew (oioi!) who I miss very much since we stopped throwing parties. Parish News used to tan this one and it always makes me want to throw down with a big grin on my face.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/7tsfJn8YdwQ?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Released in ‘82, and the track often credited as the invention of Hip-Hop. Man Parrish was the first person to use it as a title on a record anyway. A corrupt record label contract and various other struggles with the industry meant he has remained relatively obscure. It';s likely that being a gay, white, middle-class guy from Manhattan meant he was never going to be the poster boy the emerging Hip-Hop scene was after.
