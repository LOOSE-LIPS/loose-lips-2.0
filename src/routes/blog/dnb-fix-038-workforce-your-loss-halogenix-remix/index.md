![image](../imported/dnb-fix-038-workforce-your-loss-halogenix-remix/image1336.jpeg)_Atmospheric. Dark. Genius. Masterpiece. Workforce – Your Loss gets the Halogenix treatment in this week';s Dnb Fix; for what can only be described as a likely contender for remix of the year._With the end to one of the most turbulent years in recent history closing in, Halogenix is showing no signs of slowing down as he continues to release some of the best music he has ever produced. On remix duties for Workforce';s ‘Your Loss';, Halogenix has taken a fantastic track and turned it phenomenal.';Having split from household name Spectrasoul earlier this year to produce under his solo alias and release on his own label ‘Must Make';, Jack Stevens AKA Workforce has been putting out consistently interesting tunes that are pushing his very unique yet familiar sound forward.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTAQZzhIsEQ'></iframe>With sound design that is second to none and a bassline that will creep up your spine, this track could easily contend for remix of the year, and could arguably knock Halogenix';s own future classic ‘Independent'; off the top spot for best track of 2020.Out now on the Late Night Soundtrack (Remixes) EP on [Bandcamp](https://workforce.bandcamp.com/album/late-night-soundtrack-remixes)
