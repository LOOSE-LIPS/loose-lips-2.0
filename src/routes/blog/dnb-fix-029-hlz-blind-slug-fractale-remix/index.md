Fractale';s gift to the remix LP is a 170bpm flip of HLZ';s track ‘Blind Slug'; '; a heavyweight halftime track remixed into a gritty roller with tribal drums. The trio also have one of their own original productions on the release that sees Dutch Producer Subp Yao on the remix.This year has seen Fractale back with a bang, with a release on Terra Firma (which is well worth checking out) amongst many hints that there is much more to look forwards to.Unchained Recordings: The Remix LP is out tomorrow (Sept 11th); [click here to pre-order!](https://unchainedrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/unchained-the-remixes)
