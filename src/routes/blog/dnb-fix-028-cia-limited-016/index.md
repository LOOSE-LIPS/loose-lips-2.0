![image](../imported/dnb-fix-028-cia-limited-016/image1244.jpeg)_Total Science';s Bristol Based imprint; CIA, are back once again with the ill behaviour. CIA Limited 016 is a heavy release featuring 2 massive tunes updated into 2 raucous remixes. Be Warned; this 2 track cut of pure rollage, is a serious security threat to your ears._Side A is ironically named ‘Lightweight';. Don';t be fooled, this is only for the hardcore. What happens when you take an existing Drum & Bass anthem and get Break on the remix? The bomb that is ‘Lightweight';. It';s littered with Total Science samples, and stays pretty faithful to the original, though albeit with added madness. With rising tension from the offset, you can';t help feel excited knowing what the track is leading up to (come on, it';s TS & Break); a drop weightier than a black hole. Stabs, Growls, Hoovers, it';s all there in a frantic hypnotic swirl that makes this addictive roller seriously stand out for any bass head.

Leo Wood. It';s a delicious build up, awash with a refreshed vibe and weighty amounts of funk, and as the vocal hook assures us ‘something good is going on';.';Once the track drops, the main bass moves around to create intrigue, with a heavier reese coming in and out to shake things up. Piano is scattered through the track, as are some airy pads besides the mellifluous Leo Wood';s voice which creates a reflective mood although the track still goes in hard. ‘I have you'; is a proper atmospheric roller and definitely radiates that recognisable ‘Bristol'; sound. A great record for any occasion, and a great flip side to the hectic ‘Lightweight';.';
