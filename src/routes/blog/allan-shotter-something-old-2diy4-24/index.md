[](https://soundcloud.com/allanshotter-music)[https://soundcloud.com/allanshotter-music](https://soundcloud.com/allanshotter-music)Allan Shotter';s second EP on 2DIY4 tells his very personal story of that excruciating question that reads “_What if I had been more present? Could I have contributed to stopping this?_”A harrowing feeling that came to him after the recent passing of his mother, who has been through a long, arduous, but ultimately unsuccessful chemo therapy cancer treatment. During these strenuous months, producing music was his place of refuge; a sanctuary to receive his manifold emotions.And this diversity in feelings is what you can hear on “_Das Gift_”. Being overwhelmed. Feeling powerless. Drowning in uncertainty. Anger. Sadness. Being forced to wait. Hope. Hopelessness. Four tracks of raw honesty.
