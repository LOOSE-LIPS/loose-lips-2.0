Stock 808 drum kit sounds, vocal chops and sample loops are a lean recipe, yet fresh takes from the limited ingredients turn up every day, 2 decades on. ';Switch the emphasis from the rhythms to the melodies[';and you suddenly have a different genre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REmZhFKmOmo).Juke Pack Vol 1 is the embodiment of less is more. Toms bounce along to Megan Thee Stallion, moody, muffled, choppy piano chords underneath. Hypnotic chants of ‘shake it'; over growling bass, pounding toms and infinite claps. Haunting guitars over sinister raps. The foundations make it clear that EQ Why is a Chicago native, and the subtle tradition additions like skittering hi-hats show the production experience. It';s not easy to get into for new listeners – unapologetically raw in style, and the focus on rhythm might be a bit much if you';re never explored these BPMs before '; yet that';s exactly what the OG footwork sound is all about. It';s all over in 15 minutes, and each entry is begging to tear up the dancefloor arena on the regular. Essential listening for footwork fanatics._Juke Pack Vol 1 is out now as a bonus collection for[';The JUKEade: A Decade of Juke (2009-2019).](https://eqwhy.bandcamp.com/album/the-jukeade-a-decade-of-juke-2009-2019)_
