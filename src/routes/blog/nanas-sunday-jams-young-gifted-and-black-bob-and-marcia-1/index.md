![image](../imported/nanas-sunday-jams-young-gifted-and-black-bob-and-marcia-1/image1252.jpeg)_Editor';s note; the LL editorial team had a multi-layered mare last Sunday that prevented us publishing this article, and thought it made sense to release it the following Sunday. Banner artwork by [Trav](https://www.backdownwarchild.co.uk/), all of Nana';s jams are gathered in [_this playlist_](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/12UoQ8ov5i6P8BIfm2lOjS?si=jarAn1CXSEuYB9vAxJidOg)._<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/ubDVUQon5BE?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Hello Sunday Jammers, hope all is good at your end of things. A break from regular service this week. In the early hours of Saturday morning I stumbled onto the news that Chadwick Boseman had died. I was scrolling, putting off sleeping and a picture of him crossed my screen. Without even reading the caption I knew what had happened and the feelings that followed were swift, enveloping and have lingered.';Just feels a bit like a moment in a dream when you know on some level you are falling back into reality. At some point you will crash back onto the earth and make your way up through your mattress away from the dreamscape, but the bump back to reality hasn';t happened yet. Sounds insane considering I never met him in person. I knew him the same way the majority of the world did, through his various film roles, mostly recently_';21 Bridges_ and of course in _Black Panther_, as King T';Challa; the magnificent and most elegant of the Avengers.What I did get in everything I saw him was light, that man had light, dazzling and brilliant, coupled with style and grace, all the qualities I love in my movie stars. So, today';s outline is short and the track in dedicated to him. After seeing him talk about this very topic, it just seems appropriate and right, rest you well blazing light of beauty and thank you. The track **â€˜Young, gifted and black';**, the artist _Bob and Marcia,_ think it speaks for itself. So happy Sunday and back to regular next week. Peace and Much Love.
