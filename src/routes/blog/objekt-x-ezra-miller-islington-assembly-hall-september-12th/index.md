![image](../imported/objekt-x-ezra-miller-islington-assembly-hall-september-12th/image929.jpeg)I wasn';t sure that melding computer-generated, drone-like imagery to scorching sound design would work ';'; but the pairing of Object and visual artist Ezra Miller transported me out of Islington Assembly Hall and out into the stratosphere.Objekt has become a beloved name of electronic music fans of all stripes '; I enjoyed spotting several of his peers in the Highbury & Islington Wetherspoons before the set '; as 2018';s mind-bending release Cocoon Crush swung a severe-but-successful left turn after the all-conquering club success of 2017';s ‘Theme from Q';. After 8 years of touring as a DJ, Objekt decided to switch his focus to creating an immersive live show, with his intense, colourful output working in unison with visual artist Ezra Miller';s real-time generative art, mirroring his sounds with the vibrancy they deserve. As the night progresses, we';re brought into a world of singing bugs, environmental catastrophe, whirring machines and cascading patterns '; each piece in-tune with the beautiful, textured and sometimes unsettling sounds that swirl around them.Under a giant screen, Objekt and Ezra Miller face each other, lit by the screen towering over them. After a slow start caused by technical difficulties, we are absorbed into the duo';s warped world, treated to highlights from Cocoon Crush alongside highlights from the rest of Objekt';s discography. Cocoon Crush';s more ominous soundscapes are backed by insectoid faces warping across the screen, glacial mountain spaces and rumbling forestry, making the nigh-on biology-changing soundscapes of that album even more physical. Elsewhere, during 2013 banger ‘Agnes Demise';, the track';s stomping, machine-like power is reflected with images of twisting wires, pressurised structures and hammering metal plates. Objekt';s impressive range of genres '; across breakbeat, techno, ambient, noise and even a vocoder-aided ballad where Objekt';s vocals are performed by a towering crooning, caterpillar on-screen '; are even more powerful with Ezra Miller';s kinetic visuals attached. The results are stunning: like the loudest episode of Planet Earth you';ve ever stepped into.The set';s closing track ‘Love Inna Basement (Midnite XTC)'; '; which Objekt claims is in fact a ‘lost tape'; of sorts from a mysterious artist called DJ Bogdan (but it instead a reworking of ‘Theme from Q';) '; gets a gleefully daft visual palette to match its relentless raving energy. Most of Objekt';s set had the audience in head-nodding revery, so the sight of the Islington Assembly Hall losing their collective marbles as images of animals warping into new beings are beamed onto us marks a joyous highpoint of the set '; and a great way to end the night. ‘Love Inna Basement';s refrain of ‘FREE YOUR BODY AND MIND'; may come from a satirical slant, but when placed at the end of all we';d witnessed over the evening, it felt pretty potent. Long may this mind-bending partnership continue.
