![image](../imported/vinicius-honorio-signal-feat-leodosreis-sisyphon013/image964.jpeg)Hot and spicy Electro number with a Miami Bass and Techno aftertaste!The label Sisyphon is rewriting the rules of the format for its upcoming Hammahalle compilation, replacing the classic double vinyl with a real piece of the club instead.In fact the latest Hammahalle release is handmade and reflects Sisyphos'; long standing commitment to recycling and up-cycling.Each piece is unique and is constructed from original material abandoned on-site in the club';s earlier life as an East German factory, and is locked to a USB stick containing the music.The pieces will be a very limited edition.The compilation looks like it sounds. Raw, edgy, dirty – the kind of techno that takes you to the core of Hammahalle.![](/wp-content/uploads/live/img/wysiwyg/5dd3226f898a7.jpg)  
The compilation contains music from club residents Fidelity Kastrow, Jonty Skrufff and sound chief Guiamm plus exclusive new tunes from Italy';s techno producer Marco Faraone, ODD Recordings'; chief Arjun Vagale (India), Germany';s Anja Schneider, Brazilian-in-London Vinicius Honorio and Mute/Novamute legend Daniel Miller.All tracks will be available individually alongside a special DJ mix delivered by compilation curator Jonty Skrufff.From _Hammahalle_ V/A LP on [SISYPHON](https://labelsbase.net/sisyphon).Out 29.11 on 2×12" and digital.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/715115872&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>[http://soundcloud.com/sisyphon](http://soundcloud.com/sisyphon)[](http://soundcloud.com/viniciushonorio)[http://soundcloud.com/viniciushonorio](http://soundcloud.com/viniciushonorio)[](http://soundcloud.com/leodosreis21)[http://soundcloud.com/leodosreis21](http://soundcloud.com/leodosreis21)
