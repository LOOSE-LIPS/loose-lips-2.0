![image](../imported/dnb-fix-024-unknown-artist-lovely001/image1211.jpeg)_Just in time for Summer, Unknown Artist has set the perfect sonic scene on this super sumptuous, remix EP of feel-good music all at 174bpm. Layered with cheeky samples, and good vibes, this non-bootleg bootleg is Lovely by name and nature.';_Unknown Artist is back on Fokuz Records, an imprint that';s really pushing the no cheese, quality liquid dnb sound. Unknown Artist, although a name shrouded in mystery, has made a name in drum & bass for producing world-class remixes. Be sure to check out Unknown Artist';s versions of ‘Hey Now'; and ‘Need to feel loved';, absolutely massive hits that need no introduction.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPX7bcDOZms'></iframe>Lovely001 is a delicious ride for the listener from start to finish, though there';s got to be a nod to the two stand-out tracks here. ‘Just Vibe With It'; is as smooth as can be, a wonderful rolling groove broken up with a little scratch here and there which really adds to the pace of the track. ‘Just Vibe With It'; breaks down into a hip-hop half-time change up with sparkling drops of piano, which is just fabulous.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHMoof4dh4E'></iframe>‘You Know How To'; is a wonderful finish to the EP, assembled from a myriad of strings, flutes, samba drums, and euphoric vocals. Truly a funky number, shedding a little light on this Summer.';Lovely001 suggests it';s the first of a series of these wonderful EP';s from Unknown Artist, and if so, we can';t wait to hear more.';
