The Data 3 boys have really outdone themselves on this EP, these 4 huge tracks are guaranteed to go down a treat whatever the setting. Straight off the bat the EP makes a big statement with the titular production ‘Molecular';. It is already possible to hear that signature Data 3 style in the synths that they are using, and it is great to see progression in creating something similar to their previous work yet so simultaneously new and exciting. Fans that have been following them since day one are sure to be pleased with how this EP has turned out.Favourite track on this one for us has got to be Molecular; however Photon is also a phenomenal production.[](https://thisisdata3.bandcamp.com/album/molecular)[https://thisisdata3.bandcamp.com/album/molecular](https://thisisdata3.bandcamp.com/album/molecular)
