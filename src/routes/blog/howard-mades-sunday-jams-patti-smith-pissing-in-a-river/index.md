![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-patti-smith-pissing-in-a-river/image1055.jpeg)Patti patti patti. Where do I start with this beautiful human, a true fuckin' poet. This tune was written by her and Ivan Král, after a breakup. Every tune of hers has such raw emotion, you can hear the tragedy in her voice. I love her so much.Also the opening piano chord sequence, which tugs at my fucking heart strings, forms the basis for DJ Shadow's "[Blood on the Motorway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5OGk9N8Y5s)".FUN FACT: she voiced a singing baby in the rugrats movie once.
