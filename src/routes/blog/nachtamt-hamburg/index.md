![image](../imported/nachtamt-hamburg/image938.jpeg)It was almost a year ago that I first discovered the Hamburg-based label';[_Nachtamt_](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/). I was browsing online when I encountered a preview for what was at the time their latest EP. I was immediately enthralled by the pulsating bass and mesmerising soundscape of';[_Neal White '; Cistern (Nachtamt #002)_](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/album/neal-white-still-1999-nmt002).';Since that day, I would go as far to say it has become one of my favourite tracks. As a DJ and overall music-digger '; I felt obliged to track down a copy of this sublime record for myself and find out more about the label producing such a unique sound.';Originally from Schwerin, the “Owls” are dedicated to being “a guidance in the times of rapid digital ” and they aim to “signify diversity, inclusion and transparency.”';The label has been throwing parties since the turn of the millennium, and their two-decades in the industry are well reflected by their holistic approach to production. Their timeless style encompasses a broad variety of eras, moods and sub-genres.After speaking with them, I was overjoyed to hear that not only were they digitising their back-catalogue, but [_Nachtamt #003_](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/album/noone-digital-observation-nmt003)';was coming out soon.';Now that I have had a chance to enjoy it all, I thought I would reflect on their first three EPs.';[Nachtamt #001](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/album/nmt001-swarsa-nothing-quit-ep)_A1 Swarsa '; Nothing Quit__B1 Swarsa '; Captain Beep__B2 Noone '; Großer Dreesch_What I like most about Swarsa';s two productions on this EP is the transitional contrast of deep tones with warmer uplifting synth elements.';_Nothing Quit (A1)';_infuses_';_a bouncing sub-bass melody with a slightly swinging hi-hat progression and an entrancing ambience. This is followed by the etherial';_Captain Beep (B1)';_which weaves intricate percussive parts, hypnotic gated vocal loops and punctuated synth stabs to great effect.';#001 concludes with';_Großer Dreesch (B2) ';';_characterised by its rolling synth parts, tripped out soundscape and sibilant hi-hat sequence. Whilst minimal in its nature, this song could carry as much impact in an after-hour techno set as it would within a more minimal selection.';[Nachtamt #002](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/album/neal-white-still-1999-nmt002)_A1 Neal White '; Still 1999__A2 Neal White '; Cistern';__B1 Neal White '; Spulimander__B2 Neal White '; Minibaukasten_Being my first interaction with Nachtamt, this release left a lasting impression on me. It begins with _Still 1999 (A1) ';';_a combination of metallic sweeps and glitches, celestial vocal cuts, and a beefy, raw kick drum progression. Perhaps in a nod to the label';s German origins, this track is reminiscent of the fledgling 90';s minimal scene which was so heavily influenced by the underground techno movement.';Neal White moves from strength to strength on this EP, with _Cistern (A2)';_being one of my all-time favourite tracks. The track compounds its dub-driven bassline, ominous soundscape, and its intricately developed hi-hat percussive parts to great effect.The wax';s B-side first features the bewitching _Spulimander (B1) ';';_defined by its jazzy cuts, enthralling synth melodies and complex percussive patterns. This track stylistically reconciles elements of percussive techno with a more groove-oriented minimal application of its bass melody and hi-hats.';This stellar record concludes with _Minibaukasten (B2)';__';__';_which embodies greater swing to its percussion than from its predecessors. The mood from this track is largely generated by its blend of its reverb-heavy kick drums, melodic pads, and the alternation of decay on the striking hi-hats.';[Nachtamt #003](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/album/noone-digital-observation-nmt003)_A1 Noone '; Digital Observation__B1 Noone '; Brexit__B2 Brexit for noone '; Andre Kronert Rmx';_This eagerly anticipated new EP was well worth the wait. Noone';s return to Nachtamt begins with the astronomical';_Digital Observation (A1),_ a mind-bending amalgam of pounding kick drums, oscillating synth stabs and industrious hi-hats. The surging bassline at moments develops an acid-house like quality to it, at times subduing to make way for gritty soundscape.The topically named _Brexit (B1)';_spans a dubby bassline, a techno oriented percussive sequence, deep pads, melodic bleeps and glitches. This track is a continuation from';_Digital Observation';s';_stylistic use of aural texture to convey atmosphere and mood.';At 128 BPM, Andre Kronert';s';_Brexit for noone (B2)';_is a heavyweight remix of the EP';s B1. Portraying the same atmospheric mood, this remix substitutes the dubby bassline of _Brexit (B1)';_for a hard-hitting kick drum progression to create an aural quality reminiscent of an after-hours warehouse party.';Nachtamt';s third EP embodies the same grainy texture, contrasting transitions in mood and tone, and intricate percussive sequences that are becoming the trademark of Nachtamt as a label. This nuanced and politically-minded release is a continuance of the precedent of excellence set by #001 and #002. Perhaps the most experimental of their work to date '; [Nachtamt #003](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/album/noone-digital-observation-nmt003)';s exploration of varying tempos and moods has created an EP with versatile application for both DJ selectors and listeners at home.';All of Nachtamt';s music is available to buy or download [here:';](https://nachtamt.bandcamp.com/)
