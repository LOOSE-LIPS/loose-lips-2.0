[Fixate](https://soundcloud.com/fixate_uk "Fixate") · [GLARE EP](https://soundcloud.com/fixate_uk/sets/glare-ep "GLARE EP")

Old-school hip-hop bounces with a hair of Rob D vibes begin the journey. Silence. ‘Do you hear it? It';s getting closer…'; before a ferocious assault of drums, Akai';d vocals and Reece bass arrive. You can hear how Fixate';s been honing his craft for almost a decade and a half. Glare is more balanced than previous works – _therapeutic,_ even – emphasizing big builds just as much as the releases, yet it doesn';t hold back on the intensity in the slightest.';The title track is the best demonstration of that. Calming pads ease into sinister synths before Prodigy-esque choir stabs and clean, 4K snares blare. Goldie on acid. It';s all about dynamics, yin and yang, positives and negative, loud versus quiet, but the drops still hit like a sledgehammer. You might think Morbid Chatter is a moody intermission, but then off-kilter bass wobbles teleport in out of nowhere, and Wrong Foot Forward throws everything backwards with its footwork-y layers of raw lasers and rhythm. [Pin the DJ Shadow reference on the tune.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGQjrBuW-Xg)Exit Records are always looking for a way out. New territories, new styles closer to the edge. Fixate';s come up with some that sound like nothing else out there, and they';re going to leave many other producers thinking a bit deeper.
