> This is Will's ninth post-lockdown gig review, as always he did not receive payment or press tickets for this, just went as a punter and felt like there was a story there. You can read his other ones here.

Blah blah blah burnout post covid you know the drill. I was just thinking back on this year, and I realised that something strange has happened, or rather something strange for a person like me who makes sense of the world through stories and narratives, who likes to note down interesting occurrences and discuss them with pals. I was finding it tricky to remember my top nights out of 2022 off the top of my head.

I asked my partner and our best bud (we often go out as a three), and they said the same thing. I imagine that a lot of the DJs feel the same way, I saw a lot of them talking about 2022 as the longer summer of their lives, and we’re just now starting to see a wave of amazing artists cancelling shows or tours for financial reasons (eg Santigold, Blue Lab Beats and Animal Collective).

Well you know what, I may be lying in a puddle on the sofa with a head full of phlegm and 404 page errors, but goddamn it I will not let these post-lockdown memories be lost to the sands of time. These artists are fighting for their craft and our shuffling feet, and they deserve to be remembered, even if I don’t have the notes to put together a proper review; the track IDs I mention are mostly just songs that me or my buds recognized. Let’s get into it.

## Moxie & UNIIQU3 - Melt Festival, 11 & 12/06/22

Two totally different DJ sets from the best blockbuster dance festival in Europe, I'm calling it; diverse crowds, beautiful surroundings, you can swim in the lake in the morning to cool off, and it's near Berlin so people with more serotonin than me can just keep going! This year's event was a slightly funny one as the festival had been off for a year, so naturally there were some hiccups in the organisation, including moving the all-night stage right next to the campsite, not great for crotchety old men like me who like to sleep sometimes. However, one really cool addition to the festival was the 'Radio' stage, which was also right next to the campsite, but was only on in the daytime. Moreover, it was on an actual beach, you could literally wade in and out of the crowd, or lie on the side, love it.

Moxie (my favourite House/Techno DJ) did two DJ sets in the weekend, one of them was at the iconic 'Big Wheel' stage underneath an enormous crane (this kinda vibe), and one was at the Radio stage. The latter was a gorgeous moment for me, dancing with my eyes gazing out towards the water to glistening metropolitan grooves, the kind of moment that's hard to write about really, though I will share my favourite track ID, from a producer who Moxie plays out a lot; Leave Your Life by Alex Kassian. I mean, just listen to that tune, it is simply perfect. Or go ahead and listen to the full set, like all of the Radio stage sets it was livestreamed. I should say that the guy in the photo above isn't me, although he was clearly having a great time too.

Then there was UNIIQU3, on the last night of Melt festival, at the Big Wheel stage. Jersey Club really is just the best genre to make me feel crazy, partly because it’s crazy how many times I’ve had to dance to music that isn’t Jersey Club. Last year I went crazy watching Anu play a load of Jersey Club tunes, and this year we got to New Jersey Club’s hometown club queen. It was a lovely moment as my festi crew had strayed and split at points over the weekend (I spent most of that Moxie set solo), but at this time we were all together, throwing it down and being silly in the sunshine #yolo, memory is fuzzy but I thiiiink she played Twerkulater by City Girls, and she definitely played her own tunes; personal anthem Microdosing plus a fucking huge remix she made of Where’s Your Head At by Basement Jaxx.

## A.G - Vogue Fabrics Dalston, 29/07/22

This was comfortably my favourite set of the year so far, it’s also the main reason I wanted to write this article. I know a few others that I want to cover off the top of my head, but this was comfortably the best DJ set that I experienced this year (judged purely in terms of the music), and funnily enough it was the same day that my second favourite album of the year was released too; Renaissance by Beyoncé. A.G didn’t fuck around, she played like three different tracks of that album, along with recent hits like Doja by Central Cee, looping that iconic ‘how can I be homophobic, my b\*\*\*h is gay’ lyric.

It’s funny, a lot of DJs will use famous tracks to inject some life into their set, but A.G fucking bulldozed the vibe with bangers, blending up to three of them at once and twisting them in insanely creative ways that responded to the queer dancefloor in front of her, maybe my favourite was her playing a Drill remix of Lady Gaga’s Just Dance, with those massive synths sounded like heroin.

The crowd was a starkly contrasted mixture of Dalston queers and random dudes, and one of the two main speaker stacks was broken for a lot of the night, but you really cannot keep the baddest of them all down, she destroyed it and twisted it with meta moments like playing Beyoncé's Alien Superstar, with its intro 'Please do not be alarmed, remain calm, do not attempt to leave the dancefloor, the DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot test of the entire system.'

Side-note; A.G released a really sick grime instrumental production around that time called GML, with a set of different versions with different vocal styles on top of it, perfect for looping over and over in the afterglow of the dance. But yeah for the love of god people book A.G if you really wanna make people dance. I know I sound performative saying that and my audience for these articles isn’t too London promoters, it my mates and my mum, but I really really mean it.

## Shivum Sharma - Keep Hush at the Victoria Dalston, 17/08/22

This was a super bizarre one, 6pm on a Wednesday in the back of a pub, we thought Shivum was going to perform some tunes from his gorgeous, lush, super chill debut EP, as this event was under his name, but instead it was a dance event that he had curated themselves, and he DJ-ed at the very start! All the DJs were sick - Lexii had a MVP moment playing a Jersey Club remix of Waiting For Tonight by Jennifer Lopez, seriously gucci shit. But my favourite set was Shivum’s, it was really smooth and sweet and elevated, just like their EP, but also totally different because it was, you know, a dance music DJ set.

About halfway through the set, he played a voguey blend of SWV - Rain, really cute moment as it been a really rainy track that day, my bud Angus (who helped me write this review) had actually been playing the original that day at the deli where he works, lovely. Around the end there was also a remix of Liquorice by Azealia Banks, just to get my late-period-Millennial heart a flutter. Beaut. Here's a link to the stream!

## OK Williams - Possibly Maybe, Adonis, 20/08/22

This one was absolute rave bliss, taking place at the Cause’s temporary outdoor home out in Canning Town, with cable cars dotting the distant sunset. It’s worth mentioning at this point that, like a few of the events I’ve covered so far, this was a queer event, and moreover this particular event, Adonis, was home to a real queer community, 97% gay men. Add into this the fact that almost all the DJs were women/female-presenting, and you’ve got a really fun cock-tail. Ugh look guys I’m flagging, my standard of writing is not where I want it to be, you get the idea if was a cool event for me. So cool that I found myself having these big revelations about myself my life and my partner and my friend and sharing them with tears in my eyes, I’m really grateful to the Adonis crowd for welcoming us.

ANYWAY the outdoor part of the event was headlined by OK Williams, and to nobody’s surprise she smashed it, total vibes from start to finish. At one point my partner had an ‘OH MY GOD THIS SONG’ moment that meant we had to run over to the dance floor (Saturday Night - Whigfield) only to bump into my buddy who had just had the exact same moment for the previous track; Sfire 7 (by Sfire, an early project from the late trans production visionary Sophie). At the very end, OK Williams was playing some big housey tune, blended it into a looped beat, this big bumping tribalistic rrrrraaaaaawwwwr type of vibe, and then slowed that beat down, unlooped it, and allowed the track to reveal itself as Gimme More by Britney Spears (although my partner had already worked this out, come on Will you know this, I walk to this song so often). Fuuuuck me we cheered, and this gorgeous queen whose outfit we had been admiring earlier climbed up into the rafters above the DJ decks and hung above us like a sexy bat.

## Shy One, Martelo & Benji B - Notting Hill Carnival Deviation stage, 28/08/22

Notting Hill Carnival! One of my all-time favourite DJs and curators Benji B usually puts on his Deviation sound system there, I was worried it might be off this year but with two days to go he shares a cheeky animation of a whistle with a rave siren behind it on Instagram. It’s back at St Luke’s Road, the same place as last time in 2019, that August day I managed to catch the last half hour, having been working as a tour guide that day and somehow found my friends, using only the word ‘deviation’ and strangers’ directions. Well, I got a Monday to Friday job now muthafuckas, giving me enough time to rest and be nice and sober on a Saturday before heading to carnival nice n early the next day, with those same people I went to meet back in 2019, my partner and my best mate.

The stage is at the edge of the carnival site, near a tube station, so it creeps up on us suddenly as we arrive at 12:45am. Shy one had just started DJing, and the mc Judah has been wheeling up almost all of her tracks, “no no no it’s the Magnum talking”, referring to a drink that Shy One just bought that morning in an off license. How do I know that???? She posted it in her insta story, alongside her set times, she was the only DJ I knew was coming up. And yeah wowwwww she killed it, starting with a set of old school Reggae classics before sliding into modern times, with Blind To You by Collie Buddz, Fall In Love by Popcaan and Ramping Shop by Vybz Cartel. Oooooooooooh baby it felt good, the crowds hadn’t bulked yet, people were smiling, there was a random guy doing his plants on a balcony behind the stage and ye waved and the crowd whooped. A couple of times Benji B reached forward and clicked a small synth looking thing next to the decks, manipulating a serene rave siren. Ooooh ah oooh ah ooooh.

[<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20221110171516im_/https://loose-lips.co.uk/img/wysiwyg/634d581931145.jpg">](http://google.com.au/)

Then Martelo came in and the crowd got packed but he kept us moving baby, turned the tempo up dramatically, beautiful scenes, also layering in some balmy bangers like Together by Ruff Sqwad, Wasting Time by Brent Faiyaz and Millionaire by Kelis ooooh yes. You know I was actually listening to Martelo live on nts when I first got my job offer (having been trying to get a steady gig for like 16 months) what serendipity, he’s so sick.

We headed out as Sherelle came on, as the crowds were getting pretty rammed and we deserved a break. We then made the stupid mistake of trying to find a friend of ours (hands up that was my idea, I thought I could be special and pull it off), a friend whose group headed on after we got there, then my pals had to use the toilet and this took them an hour etc etc, leaving me writing the last few stand 4:12pm queuing for food whilst my mates search for toilets. I didn’t have the boost in my system to keep raving it up in the masses, but I got to see the quality, the sauce, the niceness.

Well, that’s what I wrote at 4:12pm. After wolfing down my food and finding my partner and my bud by some toilets with a humungous we caught up about our day, and decided to go back to the Deviation stage for one last hurrah. We arrived to find the music was off, someone had been injured opposite the stage and police were demanding that the crowd make way. It took ages for this to happen, and even then the police wouldn’t ok the music, leading to this really weird situation.

MC Judah standing on stage, he had been addressing the crowd over and over and over asking us to make way, and now he’s addressing the constable (he stutters), ‘we’ve done what you said, please can we turn the music back on… please… _looks out across the stage_ well I wait for your signal.” A few minutes later he repeated this, waited again, until finally he announced that the music was returning. The crazy thing is that, after a couple of rapid fire sets from a DJ and a rap performance from the Minikingz, it all ended in a 30 minute DJ set from Benji B. 30 minutes to justify all of that effort and waiting, just as I’d experienced 3 years ago. He didn’t need it, the final 3 minutes alone were worth the entry price, he finished off with Rock The Boat by Aaliyah and Family Ties by Baby Keem. Water and fire. A lot of that final set was at the gradual, head nod tempo of Rock The Boat, waves of bass rippling through us alongside the shaking sweaty tides of the crowd, yes Benji, nothing I love more than a DJ who cuts the tempo at the moment of climax, easy, there’s nowhere that we need to get to, the procession of punters trying to get from one side of the crowd to another can march on and our legs may ache but we stay here and bathe in excellence.

## Digital Mystikz - Waterworks Festival, September 17th

This festival was all a bit up and down for me, my head just wasn’t quite and some of the programming was a bit confusing. I actually messaged waterworks’ Instagram account to complain about it like a fucking nerd; “Hello hello, only saying this as last year’s festival was an absolute 10/10 for me and I hold it in such high regard, I’m a little bit disappointed with the way that this year’s set times are stacked up. I really loved how last year finished with a bunch of female DJs getting the stage-headline slot that they deserved and don’t tend to get at other events (Josey Rebelle / Saoirse / Shanti Celeste), all of this year’s stage headliners are male, and most of them are really big. But yeah I’m still super super super excited for the festival and I get that there were probably outside influences to this, just wanted to say this in case anyone in the team is interested.”

As we came to the end of the day, the problem for us wasn’t just that the a lot of the headliners weren’t particularly musically exciting for us, but the more interesting ones were just too rammed, we went from stage to stage to stage, no no no. Just when all was seemingly lost, we wandered over to the Siren stage (which last year had been an utter roadblock), and lo and behold, Digital Mystikz (the only non-white headliner) were playing to a nice comfy crowd with space to dance near the bass. They also had Sgt Pokes and Flowdan on the mics, the latter did a bit of Horror Show Style, mmmm baby I love that tune. Anyway at this point we had 45 minutes left of the festival, I ran to the bar to grab us some drinks, this process took longer than I’d have liked but I got back with 35 minutes to spare.

“This is our last song!” WHAT THE FUCK, oh god I do remember that a couple of the stages were finishing 30 mins early but I swear this wasn’t one of them, agggggghhhh fuck no time for whinging, let’s just enjoy this dirty stinking bass while we can. The track ends and cuts to silence. “Actually I don’t think it’s fair that we finish now, do you?” The next track begins. They pranked us!!! Ahaha amazing, what a croc, now we can get back to being very excited and giddy and shaking our butts to a VIP remix of Coki’s Night. “Let’s get emotional, guys… I know you’re actually sweet, even when you got a screw face I know you don’t mean it” mate I may well get up onstage and give you a kiss if you keep going like this, you saved my life. Dubstep forever!
