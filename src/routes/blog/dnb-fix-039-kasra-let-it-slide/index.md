![image](../imported/dnb-fix-039-kasra-let-it-slide/image1349.jpeg)_All rise for King Kasra, the man that gifted Critical Records to the world. This week';s DnB Fix features another treat from the pioneering boss himself. With his latest release "Let It Slide" featuring Slay; and the introspective B side "I Don';t Know What The Future Brings"._Born in 2002; the Critical sound has been growing within the underground drum & bass scene through the years, with their influence in 2020 being stronger than ever. The label has pioneered and paved the way for many of the artists we know and love today, with Kasra gaining royalty status along the way.His first release on Critical was a two-track release with Stray, one of Critical';s finest products. Since then, a Kasra cameo has been something of a rare treat, collaborating with various critical top boys from time to time until 2018 when we were blessed with his first full solo release, Ski Mask EP.The first lockdown of 2020 has left a lot of people with spare time on their hands, Kasra included. Coming out of the other side, he cleared his Instagram account, uploaded a single post announcing that the start of a new phase in his career as a producer was here; with a new two track release "Let It Slide/I Don';t Know What The Future Brings." being the first proof he';s here to conquer.

"Let It Slide" is a new age take on the classic Critical Sound, featuring Manchester MC Slay. Built for the dance, this beat oozes flavours from label acts past and present, without straying from the true Critical DNA that Kasra has been injecting us with for the past 18 years. MC Slay addresses the masses with a strong message, “You can take all of your shots but you will not take my pride, I will not let it slide” as the beat rolls and rides through the system. I can only dream of the reaction Kasra will get once this is dropped back in the rave.The B side shows us his further development and maturity with a beautiful stripped back steppa, further emphasising that Critical feel. The infectious bass subtly rolls around the soundscape and takes you on a journey from the offset. "I Don';t Know What The Future Brings" is a real treat and I can';t wait to hear more of this style develop in future releases.This release has it all and is a must have for the headz; and is [Out now](https://shop.criticalmusic.com/vinyl/crit157) on Critical records digitally and on limited edition 10” Orange & Black vinyl.
