![image](../imported/howard-mades-sunday-jams-chavela-vargas-paloma-negra/image1084.jpeg)I';s sunday again, and I';m in my garden trying to play this on my guitar with a string missing and growling at my dog, trying to recreate her growl at 1.42 (god it';s good). Might buy a bottle of tequila, not sure.';This ranchera song has been covered by many but this version is my favourite, its originally sung by Lola Beltran but I heard this rendition first on “Frida”, a film about the life of Frida Kahlo, then a friend of mine put it on her story the other day and it inspired me to dig deeper into mexican music, made a decent playlist actually.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/OanOkaXRvoM?wmode=opaque'></iframe>
