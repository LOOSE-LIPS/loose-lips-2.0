![image](../imported/dnb-fix-027-harka-days-thinkin-ep/image1239.jpeg)_The Dreamers'; catalogue has always been about what';s possible rather than what';s already been done. This week';s DnB Fix explores that with Harka._He might wonder around the BPMs of drum and bass, but you';re more likely to hear Yung Chop snares, reggae vocals and J Dilla sirens than apache breaks (that';s in there too). His fluid, furious and non-stop movement doesn';t sound quite like anything else.';The percs on Body Talkin'; might signal jungle, but the bassline feels hyper reggae. Days Talkin'; feels jazzy house in the language of footwork, surprise sax soaring it into a blissful plane. 45 mashes up halftime ingredients into donk-y 4×4 glory, and Haste sounds like grime if it was invented at a festival after-party.
