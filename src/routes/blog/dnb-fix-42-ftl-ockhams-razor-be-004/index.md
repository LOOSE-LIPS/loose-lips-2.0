![image](../imported/dnb-fix-42-ftl-ockhams-razor-be-004/image1377.jpeg)_This week';s Dnb Fix comes from Beyond Electronix, a sub-label of the legendary Brighton based Electro record label Further Electronix, bringing the exceptional ‘Full Metal Junglist EP'; to fruition._From the super low-key alias FTL, who I can only assume is one of the minds behind the record label or an incognito alter-ego from an already established artist. Full Metal Junglist is a 4 track assemblage of that imperfectly perfect, ';diamond in the rough'; Jungle sound we all know and love.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wn7K3CT6RhY'></iframe>Ockham';s Razor; named after the age-old philosophical rule of thumb, basically implying its best to not overcomplicate shit, is a shining example of exactly that. A simplistic, pleasingly unchallenging piece of raw Jungle-Techno. There is almost zero information to be found anywhere on the internet regarding FTL currently, other than this stellar release and a few links that tail back to the F.E Soundcloud and Bandcamp pages. All I can hope is that this is a name to be watching out for in 2021.If you';re lucky you';ll still be able to grab a copy over at [Redeye](https://www.redeyerecords.co.uk/vinyl/129017-b-e-004-ftl-full-metal-junglist-ep)
