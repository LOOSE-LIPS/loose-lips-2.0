![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-percy-sledge-the-dark-end-of-the-street/image895.jpeg)This week I';ve chosen Percy Sledge '; The Dark End Of The Street. Sledge is most well known for "When A Man Loves A Woman" which easily could be a Sunday Jam. Sledge';s soulful voice is backed by a dreamy guitar riff that carries the track magically bar to bar, topped with heart warming backing vocals. Sledge has something of a rags to riches story, coming from working in the fields of Alabama to being one of the greatest soul singers of all time. The track itself is supposedly about cheating and was penned by Dan Penn & Chips Moman. The story goes that while cheating at a game of cards on their break they wrote the track in a matter of half an hour. Hi Records founder, Quinton Claunch let the pair use his hotel room to write the track on one condition, that they give him the track for James Carr, and so they did with it later becoming his most famous track. Although Sledge';s version did not reach the same heights in the charts at the time, it';s certainly my favourite rendition of a track thats been covered many times.
