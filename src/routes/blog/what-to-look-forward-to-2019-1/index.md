![image](../imported/what-to-look-forward-to-2019-1/image731.jpeg)As 2018 ends, Loose Lips takes a look forward to the most exciting events to put in your diary for 2019. Although this was originally supposed to be for all of 2019, the crew had too many good suggestions for January and February alone, so we may get another edition out soon!

**Matt Hardy '; Festival Forte (Portugal) 22-25 August**After attending for the first time last year, it was one of the first dates in my diary. The spectacular line up at this single stage festival matches the extraordinary scenery of the Montemor-o-Velho Castle and surrounding towns in Portugal. Certainly a unique event. Inside tip: make sure you grab a hot dog at the stand next to the entrance '; let';s just say that it';s not your typical hot dog.

**Joss '; Alfa Mist '; (Village Underground, London) 13 May**It';s been a while since I';ve been to this venue, but it';s still one of my favourites. Interesting to be there when hosting a night that isn';t techno.

**Kenny '; Tobias Shmidt & Neil Landstrumm (Pussypower, Glasgow) 23 February';**Sugar Experiment Station, not so much acid, more like Atomic Techno; fierce funk; melting steel; somewhere between Scotland, Jupiter, a magnesium octopus and crystal wasp swarm; the distant memories of the first ecstasy wars where the future is an illusion; something in the water; something in the weather.These are just words, It';s all in the music. From the Ultimathule EP released in 1996 to last years releases, the Kaptagon ep on Shipwrec, Swap Vinegar for Mango on Varvet and everything in between.Ultimately SES are all about the live performance. Their show has classically been experimental techno hardware improvisation with heavy sub bass and ripping techno bleep abstraction.Ultima Thule '; the most distant point in the known solar system reached by NASA in January 2019; SES were there in 1996.
