![image](../imported/charity-waxmas-ep-acid-waxa-its-christmassss/image1368.jpeg)Your eyes spring open, you jump up out of your deep hibernation pod. Your Amazon incorporated Alexa smart-home shouts at you through every wall, floor, ceiling, cupboard and orifice with a synthesised vocal palate that resembles an uncanny likeness of Noddy Holder performing fellatio on a Dalek.';The year is 2050, Christmas day to be exact. The one day of the year you get to enjoy to yourself. No 16-hour shift packaging Bezos'; Original Recipe Nutrient Dense Meal Supplements down at the fulfilment centre today. No. You get to really kick back and relax.What a better way to enjoy your time, than spending 2800 hours worth of Employee Reward Credits (approximately £5.00 in old money value) on the latest ‘Charity Waxmas'; EP courtesy of Acid Waxa.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/s81UEnPlA2A?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Packed full of non-stop, funky fresh yuletide resonators. Charity Waxmas is the only collection of festive themed, 303 fabricated psychoacoustics you need this holiday.';With tracks from AYU Acid, Roy of The Ravers, Romeo Taylor and Christopher Rave, you';ve got enough content to keep you going as you blast through that bottle of Vodka and wait for your Christmas dinner to materialise out of the UberEats particle-exaggerator in what would have be your kitchen.So sit back, relax, and enjoy the best 28 minutes of the year. (Consumer experience may vary). Ohh and I did mention that all the money goes to charity?<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2055776131/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/'></iframe>
