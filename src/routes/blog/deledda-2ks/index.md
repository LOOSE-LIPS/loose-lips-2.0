Could you introduce yourselves in a few words to our readers?_Here';s Ludovico Schilling (SCHiLLiNG), founder of Apparel Tronic together with Giuseppe DʼAlessandro (Kisk).  
A couple of years ago we started a new project called 2KS which is the natural result of our shared musical influences, mainly coming form the UK: Brokenbeat, Nu-Jazz, West London, Nu-Garage, Jungle,  
D&B etc. But being two different souls often leads to try new things out and thatʼs where interesting things happen in terms of musical experimentation: like meeting Alessandro Deledda (pianist, composer, founder and director of the piano school ‘Piano, Soloʼ in Perugia) and making this record together, which weʼre really happy to introduce to you now._Where does the idea of Spore EP stem from?_With 2KS we never know what the future holds but weʼre always ready for it '; letʼs say '; so when we met Deledda a while ago, right away we felt like we wanted to create the opportunity to collaborate. Deledda, whoʼs already a super talented pianist, wanted to test himself on a new ground and we were ready to support him all the way through with our experience and sound.Thatʼs how it all began: just a strong will to produce some new music together! We didnʼt plan when or how to do it, it just happened. One day Deledda shared some piano creations with us, named Spore, which heʼd just made with the help of David Giacchè (fonia, effects) and we instantly loved it; that set the blueprint for the start of our work. Since the first listening of Deleddaʼs excerpts we knew we had to let such a masterly played piano be the protagonist of the record, so we humbly tried to honour it in the best possible way.Ludovico then started to compose some some harmonies and melodies with his synths, recording processed vocals and playing around with effects and Giuseppe supervised the whole work recording and choosing himself many sound effects that were later used. The name Spore, same in English and Italian, seemed perfect as the title of the EP being it, literally, a minute reproductive unit capable of giving rise to a new individual (a characteristic of lower plants, fungi, and protozoans)._![](/wp-content/uploads/live/img/wysiwyg/5f6115887a9c7.jpg)__What is your common source of inspiration when collaborating on a project?_On this specific project, as 2KS, we followed the guidelines of some of our favorite composers like Steve Reich or Gigi Masin, two masters in composing ambient music, playing with sound design etc. I (SCHiLLiNG) love to prove myself on different styles of music and Ambient is surely one of my favourite genres, itʼs something that flows quite naturally, instinctively in me. Giuseppe played a fundamental role too, of course, leading me in the right way with his great taste.';After a few years we established a workflow where everyone does what they do best, so to speak. But the biggest inspiration came from Alessandro (Deledda) himself who brought his musical attitude and was keen  
to mix it up with ours; so the best inspiration came from the feelings us three shared, from the beginning, rather than music._How did you organise your sessions? Did you mostly work online or in studio?_The EP has been produced during the Corona Virus pandemic which forced us to work separately. We would have loved to meet altogether and work in the studio but we also think that the whole mood of the record, peaceful and blissful, dark and luminous at the same time, fits quite perfectly the historical period that we were going through. For this reason, the fact of being stuck at home studio with no chance to meet gave us, unintentionally, the perfect chance to work on _Spore_ individually, taking time, not compromising nor  
rushing things and not feeling forced to deliver in a specific moment.Sometimes working on your own and then puzzling everything together is the best way to let everyone express their deepest creative feelings. Said that, weʼre already looking forward to rehearsing together once the Corona virus madness is over: weʼre literally craving to play Spore live._Was this project the start a a more frequent collaboration between you?_We really hope so. Alessandro is a great guy: a truly brilliant and versatile musician who likes to experiment new things, matching perfectly with our vision. He instantly manifested his will to collaborate with us and we thank him for this.One of our aims is to work with people that can add either a human and creative value to our labels; we mainly look for quality, in every sense, because the effort we put in with our artists and projects in terms of time, professionalism, kindness, availability is massive and we know itʼs not always possible to get the same amount of energy back. When it happens is the best reward!_What individual projects do you have planned?_Well first of all, as a trio, we want to make this a live project once the situation of the Pandemic will allow us to rehearse and weʼre already thinking about the right places to organise some live shows.As individuals, Giuseppe (Kisk) is about to launch is first solo album called Jazzysm (Apparel Music) which is a remarkable selection of 10 tracks heʼs been working on since a few months and which perfectly represents his taste and influence. I (SCHiLLiNG) am currently working to perfect my 3rd solo album hoping it will be ready before the end of the year; itʼs been a massive effort and Iʼm so proud of what it is becoming.There will be many great musicians involved and It will be a mixture of all my influences brought together by my taste and vision. I canʼt wait to tell you more. Last but not least, Alessandro, whoʼs acting on several fronts: he will release a piano solo record on another big label before the end of 2020 and heʼs also busy with his other band called Aura Safari, a great ensemble which brings together live musicians, sound designers, electronic music producers and with which they make a nice blend of Deep House, Ambient, Downtempo, Jazz-Funk.They';ll release some new music too in the next months.
