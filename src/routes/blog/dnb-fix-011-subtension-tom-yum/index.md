![image](../imported/dnb-fix-011-subtension-tom-yum/image1080.jpeg)_This stupid isolation isn’t going to stop us keeping you locked and loaded with the hottest Drum & Bass week in week out; this week's Fix comes from Subtension and the Flexout Audio imprint._ Flexout Audio seems only natural for a producer such as Subtension; the young Slovakian has been building pace within the industry for many years, and with releases across a number of major labels, including Critical and Neosignal in recent times; it’s no surprise his tracks are getting picked up by the biggest names on the circuit.

The introduction paints a dulcet vision of a dystopian future, a myriad of sounds coming together in complex harmony. With anticipation built by a mixture of glitchy synths and minimal hats; the tempo seems ever-growing as we're joined by subdued kicks. An acid laden bass creeps in ominously in its execution; before a heavily stompy drop pumps 40Hz into your chest.  Expect to see this track keeping sets building at a live stream near you. Across the rest of the EP we have a broad spectrum of drum and bass style; “Stay” harnesses the deep and darker sounds; with “pho” evoking memories of big room anthems pumping out on a summer’s day; with the whole release being nothing short of mesmerising.
