![image](../imported/btek-musicology/image748.jpeg)**A few words with Btek, an independent DJ, A&R and Bookings Agent in the northern scene.**[Facebook '; BT3KMusicology](https://www.facebook.com/BT3KMusicology/)

**Talking about his events brand Musicology and events that are lined up for 2019:**I have worked on the Elements events for 6 years alongside Nick Divine and Laurie Burton '; Elements is strictly for hip hop gigs. Through running these events my passion grew and I decided I wanted to start a new brand, delving deeper into sonic territories '; that';s were Musicology was born. We put on underground events in intimate arts venues as a study of music, creating something different from your usual event. The ethos of musicology is to ask artists to play in more intimate surroundings and';to play what they want, however they want and for as long as they want. Musicology aims to combine all styles of creativity, mixing in live art, live visuals, immersive decor and custom artwork. All profits from our events will feed back into the art spaces and venue';s to keep them alive because small independent venues are vital for the underground music scene. The imagery and branding for musicology was created by Dan Dowker.

**On the start of M****usicology.**Jazzy T and Dr Zygote 2018 was the first gig. They played for 5 hours and brought 7”s, 12”s, CD';s and laptops '; ';the full works. They took us on a musical journey, there were only 50 people through the door but everyone felt the energy and understood what Musicology was aiming to be.

**On the four events coming up in 2019**[Loefah x SUMGii 5hr + (DMZ, SWAMP 81, 616, Potent FUNK)](https://www.facebook.com/events/500744403750447/)';8th Feb @ Freedom Mills Leeds5 hours of playing what they want how they wantLoefah runs Swamp 81, a label that';s really caught my ears over the years. The same can be said for Sumgii with his labels 616 and Potent Funk that push really interesting music. I always loved Loefah';s Norwood Soul Patrol show on Rinse FM, where he explores all genres and grooves, so it';s great to have got Loefah on board with Musicology. I saw that Sumgii was covering the Swamp 81 show, and I';d worked with him before, so I approached him with the idea and he got in touch with Loefah and we got it booked in. They are bringing along Illaman to host their set, who is part of “problem child” alongside Dabbla, Sumgii and Double Edge.';For this event, support comes from PATRICE.

[Foreign Beggars 22nd Feb @Eiger Studios](https://www.facebook.com/events/219655858910263/)We';ve got Foreign Beggars to play a 3hour DJ set, spanning across their influences '; not just the average club set. They haven';t toured in the UK for years so this is a once in a blue moon chance to see them play in an intimate surrounding. Foreign Beggars started out releasing on there own label dented records and since then they have released on Deadmau5';s label Mau5trap and worked alongside Noisia / Alix Perez / Skrillex / Bare Noize (to name a few names). Support for this one coming from Ghost Town.

[Musicology x Bassface Present: Dabbla (Death Moves album tour)](https://www.facebook.com/events/1935311869850319/)Dabbla is a big part of High Focus Recordings and also a member of Dead Players alongside Jam Baxter and Ghost Town.';Dabbla fits with the musicology etho';s because his lyrical content is really wide spread and he speaks his mind on all sorts of issues. I worked with Jam Baxter on a show at studio 24 in 2018 and after that went so well they contacted me to arrange the Leeds leg of Dabbla';s tour, last year he released his award winning year of the monkey album and this year will see his return with his next album “death moves” on Potent.
