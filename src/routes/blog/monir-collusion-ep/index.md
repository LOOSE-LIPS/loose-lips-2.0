You ever hear a weird tune in a DJ set that makes you think ‘what is this?'; That';s bass. It';s the abstract. A genre that has evolved out of the grey area between garage, dubstep, grime, techno and everything in between. Keysound Recordings have been rolling that sound along since 2005, and there';s plenty of places where you can [catch](https://hyphomcr.bandcamp.com/album/unreleased-vol-2) [glimpses](https://szns7n.bandcamp.com/album/lcy)';[of](https://nervoushorizon.bandcamp.com/album/nh-v-a-vol-1)  
[it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgNi9kX5q9g), but it was a sound you had to search for. Then one day, a Facebook group appeared. Essential DJ [Eich](https://soundcloud.com/eichldn?fbclid=IwAR23eI4QziQecqyZxZ6t5goNsKBhGZXTxbtiYbfenRB2KpZp8ZrTUgV1J8M) thought she';d make a place to talk about all that non-jazz whilst DJing it, and in less than a year, [More Cowbell](https://www.facebook.com/groups/morecowbelluk/) gained a thousand members. It';s become the primary hub for exploring that sound, and now they';re showcasing the new talent emerging from those 130BPM-ish depths on a label, due for release on the first of July.Monir';s details show experienced hands. The title track, _Collusion_, kicks everything off in the highest gear. Busy percs dance around creepy synth swells, haunting female vocals echo, lazer zaps and angry claps. It refuses to stop swerving with a snarl. _The Instinct';_skips like an El-B vinyl, complete with sharp hats and vox that blimp in and out of existence, but the sinister synths and growls give it a futuristic edge. There';s even a cheeky amen. Distorted brass cries out in the distance on _Overpass_ whilst the bass pulses like lights racing past your wingmirror, Resident Evil opening credits fading into view. Cyberpunk meets Saw.The Collusion EP';s palette is hard to box in, but the vibe it sets is easy to understand. ';It gets you moving on the floor, but you wouldn';t be surprised if everyone had their hoods up. It';s an identity statement, club music for people who appreciate mood. And Merzbow, but nowhere near that harsh. Get into the Corsica groove.
