He welcomed anyone visiting to Japan into his home, introduced them to his family and';went above and beyond to accommodate people with such warmth.As someone who has supported Club Glow from the';beginning as well as each of us individually, we';ve pulled together a host of like minded artists who either knew Naoki personally or someone who we knew he';d like and put together a jam packed tape for all of you
