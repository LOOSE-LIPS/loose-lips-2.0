![image](../imported/the-first-deep-cuts-art-auction/image1279.jpeg)Welcome to the first ever Deep Cuts auction! We recently hosted our first Deep Cuts event, during which DJs performed themed sets, with each set reflected by a different visual artist, painting their interpretation of the set live, on the spot (based on our Deep Cuts articles wherein different people share music along a shared theme, once a month).';Needless to say it was a headfuck to organise, but we were blown away with the result. Simply put: it worked. An amazing variety of personal, characterful art was created over the 9 hour event. Everyone delivered, often in ways and styles that were totally unexpected.';I wrote an [article';](http://loose-lips.co.uk/blog/our-first-deep-cuts-event-130920)about the event with more background, but this isn';t about me, this is about the [Ruff Sqwad Arts Foundation](https://www.ruffsqwadarts.org/about). The whole point of Deep Cuts is encouraging people to express themselves, to speak in their own voice, so it only felt right that all the event';s proceeds go to this amazing charity. It';s run by a pair of Grime legends, providing young people with resources, opportunities, collaborative sessions and general footholds into the creative industries. All money from this auction (minus delivery fees) will go to RSAF.';This auction (which will conclude at midday on Saturday the 10th of October), gathers the themed artworks from our event, alongside a bunch of fantastic spontaneous artworks created by event guests sat in front of the speakers, and an amazing gift from [Trav](https://www.backdownwarchild.co.uk/); the hand-drawn sketches that went on to become his amazing Deep Cuts article';illustrations. I always assumed he did them with a digital stylus, it';s mad.Please send bids to will@loose-lips.co.uk, they must be atleast £1 above the current bid. Best wishes, Will x
