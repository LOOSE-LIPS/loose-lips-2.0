![image](../imported/dnb-fix-40-altern8-hard-crew/image1350.jpeg)_25 years after blasting onto the scene with massive singles like ‘Frequency';, Altern 8 have returned. ';This week';s Dnb Fix takes a closer look at Hard Crew, in all it';s remixed glory, featuring the likes of Samurai Breaks, Denham Audio, Mechanizm & Kin._Hard Crew sounds like it';s emerged from a perfectly preserved 1994 hard drive '; vocal chops, rave stabs, noisy ambience, breaks and punchy kicks meld together on a warm mix '; perfectly harkening back to classic rave vibes.';Mechanizm & Kin';s remix brings the most agg: blistering amen chops paired up with a belting 808, as the vox pop in and out with blink-and-you';ll-miss-it halftime switch ups. Samurai Breaks comes up with some pure cheeky fun on his remix, skipping the lead into a bouncy 4×4 floor-thumper, vinyl scratches from DJM crossfading into proceedings at just the right moments. Denham Audio take the track in a more atmospheric direction, making it into a patient break roller. It';s one of those rare cases where each remix takes the original in a distinct and memorable direction '; here';s to more bangers!<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1574157845/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/'></iframe>
