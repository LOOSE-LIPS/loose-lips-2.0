![image](../undefined)_';So Strange'; – no two words could better describe the current scenario we are all faced with. The whole world has been grounded and it is starting to look like summer 2020 will officially be cancelled; (not that I think this is inherently a bad thing as it is most definitely for the best, yet I';m going to avoid getting into politics…)_Nevertheless, this week';s DnB Fix comes from Tim Reaper and Dwarde; their contribution to a 3 part series of compilations put out by London based Lobster Theremin; off the back of the waived fees across Bandcamp last month. The sentiment behind these releases was to help raise money for charity including _Mind';_and _Shelter,';_as well as creating a fund to help contributing artists and the music community.'; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; '; ';';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/779584705&color=%230e6e64&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>

So Strange speaks for itself really, an Amen heavy Jungle track with oodles of character and that raw 90';s sound we expect from the pair. Bordering on Darkside at points with its use of sinister vocals samples and ambient minor scales; It';s so simple, yet infinitely great.Perhaps the potential boom in creativity is the silver lining to this period of enforced isolation and self-reflection we are all facing. I for one, am interested to see what amazing things people come up with over the next few months.Check out the rest of the release over at [Lobster Theramin](https://lobstertheremin.com/album/lobster-plur-volume-1)
