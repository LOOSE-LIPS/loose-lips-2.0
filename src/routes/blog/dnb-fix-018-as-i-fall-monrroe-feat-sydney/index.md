![image](../imported/dnb-fix-018-as-i-fall-monrroe-feat-sydney/image1150.jpeg)_Having floated around the liquid scene for many years… no pun intended, Monrroe has been honing in on and truly mastering his own sound; his latest release “As I Fall” on Shogun Audio is a perfect example of how his diligence has paid off; by carefully balancing the delicate vocals of Sydney Chapman with raw uncompromising rollers._Rising through the ranks, Monrroe';s story starts a similar one to many of us in this industry; what a normal listener scrolling through hours on tunes on YouTube, namely Liquicity, turned into a life-changing opportunity when he sent over “Dawning”. The rest is history.Years later, and his less than systematic approach to Drum & Bass has allowed his innately organic style, often compared to the likes of Hybrid Minds and Etherwood; to carve a path across some of the industries finest labels, such as SGN, Fokuz, Galacy and more recently, Shogun Audio.Monrroe has spoken highly of his exposure to 90s Jungle as he was growing up; courtesy of his “certified junglist” mum, but it';s truly his own conscientiousness and aspiration that has got him where he is today; taking in elements of the ambient by incorporating real-life samples to add that human depth to his tracks; through to the precise audio engineering that goes into each individual drum; a structured approach commonplace in DnB productions a lifetime over. But, it';s not just the drum and bass labels fawning over it; with the team over at Anjunabeats; the highly influential trance label; clearly noticing him too, asking him to produce a remix for 3LAU.

“As I Fall” is nothing short of yet another production masterclass. Led into the track by the powerful vocals of Sydney Chapman; the atmosphere builds with growing sub-bass and accompanying piano licks. ';Minimal drums lay down the foundation for a multitude of growls and barks; held together by that all-encompassing roller.Here';s to hope that in the current lockdown; Monrroe is working super hard on creating even more ground-breaking music; because, I';m sat here, waiting to hear more from an artist who is quickly becoming a personal favourite.

You can cop the tune over at Beatport now.[@sydneychapmanlondon](https://www.instagram.com/sydneychapmanlondon/)[@monrroe\_uk](https://www.instagram.com/monrroe_uk/)[@shogun\_audio](https://www.instagram.com/shogun_audio/)
