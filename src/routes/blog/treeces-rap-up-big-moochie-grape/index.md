This mixtape is a serious statement, not only establishing himself in the scene but forever continuing Memphis'; legacy on Hip Hop as a whole. ';

Big Mooch is one of Young Dolph';s most recent signings to the ever impressive; ';Paper Route Empire';, a Memphis trap label with a cult fan base stretching across the globe '; although gaining more mainstream attention recently, real fans know the formula has been unstoppable for years now. With a DIY ethic and an impressive roster home to the likes of Key Glock, Jay Fizzle, Kenny Munney and of course the CEO Young Dolph; Paper Route Empire is the modern embodiment of southern';independence in Hip Hop. Frequently releasing tapes packed full of Trap bangers, it was only a matter of time until the whole team elevated to a higher level of success. The scale of this real underdog-driven, self-made come up, hasn';t been seen since the days of Master P';s ';No Limit Records';!

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBJy9KWV7zc&list=PLp3XtSlORTbQVmOp9WS5zXqn7KyhXk2op&index=3)This is music truly made from the trap. Already making a name for himself on the streets of Memphis, Mooch enters the tape on ';Eat or Get Ate Intro'; asserting himself as ';The Youngest Don'; & ';The Hottest Shit Out Right Now';, pure confidence linking each bar, whilst the bassline creeps across the track, reminiscent of that classic Memphis sound. ';Uh Huh'; seems to be the obvious choice as a single, the simple hook is';undeniably catchy and a World Star Hip Hop premier helped to create a lot of noise in the run up to the tape';s release. It';s in moments like these that it';s easy to see how comparisons to the Gucci Mane of old have come about '; not only does Moochie sound like Gucci when shouted in an adlib, but the rapper';s southern drawl rides the beat with the same arrogance as a young La Flare. Bandplay';s production is the';highlight of ';Three Months';, a haunting melody sits on top of poppin'; 808s that you know are going to sound banging on a car soundsystem. In fact, Bandplay';s production is unstoppable throughout the tape, mixing the sound of Memphis forefathers such as Shawty Pimp and Tommy Wright with a modern day sound; the lo-fi grain being swapped out for a clean studio master.';  
_';From the bottom, I made it to the top and I became a problem';_  
Big Mooch manages to maintain full throttle energy throughout the tape, showing off different sides to his game as it progresses. There';s an intelligent use of Auto-Tune on ';Big Juice'; and his';delivery switch up on the single and penultimate track, ';Clusters';, could well be his finest moments on the release. This is not a ground-breaking album/tape, but this is still up there with the finest trap music 2020 has to offer.

If you';re new to Paper Route Empire, this is a good place to start…and then make sure to check out Key Glock';s new release and keep your eye';s on every movement PRE makes this year. Make sure you';re supporting the artists and come back in two weeks time for the next Rap Up. More Life.';

Often live streaming day to day from the Trap House, it wont be long until Big Moochie Grape makes some serious music money.';
