![image](../imported/dema-persistence-of-visions-ep-ibd002/image840.jpeg)With his _Persistence of Visions_ EP, DE:MA presents 3 rolling Dub-Breakbeat (is that a thing? It is now!) tracks ready for the open, peak and close of your night.';_Persistence of Visions_, a murky warm-up tune, features warm swinging beats that provide space for ricocheting percussion, dragging dancers into a stoned sway and steady head-bop.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/627538329&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>_Memory Bank_, the second track, is more up-tempo and wouldn';t sound out of place in a Djrum set or on Burial';s USB stick. Tight percussion zips back and forth while ethereal pads and sound design hum through the mix to dramatic effect.';_Blue Champagne_ is the most upbeat of the three. Shuffling high-hats keep the subtly broken beat chugging away steadily. An uplifting key change half way through offers a glimpse into a potentially euphoric “I love you man” moment, before plummeting back to the depths from whence it came.On remix duties are three artists offering their own interpretation of _Blue Champagne_.';6ISS';s is distortion-heavy with industrial elements which ploughs on but can feel convoluted at times where the sounds stack up.';The second, from Nothing is Real, introduces the first 4/4 kick drum in the EP.  
It fits into the bracket of head-down Industrial Techno as it pounds alongside swirling glitches and extra-terrestrial sound effects.';PETRU offers another four to the floor excursion, with spacious percussion that rattles in unison with ye olde kick & high-hat combo that is commonplace to this type of peak-time Techno.
