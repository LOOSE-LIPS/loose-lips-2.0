**Imaginative style icon';**[Olivia Healy](https://oliviamhealy.com/)**';creates powerful figures that celebrate femininity and dance culture. Her work has been moulded by the scenes she is a part of and as a result they reflect today';s culture in a true form. Her work exploded on her moving to London and she began to embody the forms she depicted, not only blending together culture and music to inform her visuals, but also becoming a human representation of her subject matter, an embodiment of her art.**

But her inclusion in the drag and dance scenes of london melded her subject matter into something that took this meditative approach and inverted it into an explosive celebration of current drag parties.';**

**Olivia talks about the meditative roles of nightlife and artwork in her life, both being a means to let go and focus on her immediate surroundings in their audio and visual manifestations. Her artwork reflects this celebration of moments and scenes in her totemic, almost religious homages to god-like beings; pure reflections of the energy of nightlife.**

**

Olivia is ‘also drawn to the inclusivity of nightlife, which seems to far surpass the rest of society in the amount of both diversity and togetherness experienced on the dance floor.'; Her art reflects this beautifully, offering imagined idealist figures that are icons of fierce style and image.**
