![image](../imported/silkie-dont-dj-for-free-rhythm-junkie-ep-pretty-weird-records/image734.jpeg)Coming correct with a serious bassline,';[Silkie](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/silkie)';s ';Dont Dj For Free'; really takes me back to my teenage induction into bass music. In this track, what stands out for me is the distorted and crushed wah-wah sound twinned with the infectious ';itch n'; scratch'; beats and cheeky 808 cowbells and you got a sure-fire dancefloor banger. The well-cut vocals add the extra an extra layer and forge the old-school US footwork flex with the juke-ish 808 grooves that really gives this tune a unique but recognisable feeling. After pushing through the first minute of bass warfare and you are soon confronted by some very very greazy, ice-cold stabs and arps that, personified, would be like some kinda 9th dimension hell-demon smiting you down with a serious broadsword — ';whipclang shupang';!Flaming hot ';n'; spicy, ';Dont Dj For Free'; should be handled with care.';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/525720132&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>  
On _that_ side, ';Rhythm Junkie'; holds the real lowdown sleaze of the release. Such a sassy groove could be played almost anywhere in a rave, at a beach bar, or even at a family gathering. This track has heaps of soul and emotion combined with that ghettotech-y kinda kick pattern and all the swung garage/soca/footwork drums makes for a track that you can';t resist moving to. The funky out-of-the-blue stabs really remind me of early [Phaeleh](https://soundcloud.com/phaeleh). Then. just when you thought it was all safe — ';OH SHIT!'; — here comes the red-alert klaxon, doubled up with those snappy soca-style claps that really push the energy forward. But there';s no need to fear the next pattern — ';Rhythm Junkie'; doesn';t turn aggressive; instead, it just swings back into that low-slung sleaziness you know and love.';Well-crafted and full of emotion, yet still weighted down with that bumpy bassline, ';Rhythm Junkie'; is almost techno, but it ain';t…<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/522691614&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'></iframe>Silkie ';';_Don';t Dj For Free / Rhythm Junkie EP_ came out on [Pretty Weird Records](https://soundcloud.com/prettyweirdrecords) on November 9, 2018.
