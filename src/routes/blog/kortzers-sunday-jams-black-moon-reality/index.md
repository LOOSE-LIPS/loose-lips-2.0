![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-black-moon-reality/image898.jpeg)The week';s selection comes from Brooklyn';s Black Moon. This is easily one of my favourite Hip Hop tracks and a Sunday Jams banger in its own right. The beat itself sets the tone from the start, sampling Quincy Jones';s soothing strings. The track feels lazy, but in a good way and instantly creates a feeling of relaxation, yet the piano stabs that come in give the track a certain edge that is the cherry on top of the cake a truly makes its one of the best Hip Hop tracks of all time. Reality suites Sunday down to the ground and I hope you feel the same way about it as I do!
