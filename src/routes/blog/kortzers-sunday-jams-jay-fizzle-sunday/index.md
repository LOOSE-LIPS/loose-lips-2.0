![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-jay-fizzle-sunday/image950.jpeg)I';ve chosen something abit different this week in the fashion of Jay Fizzle. This track came out yesterday if I';m correct and comes straight from Memphis! After spending some time in Memphis with Medallion Man earlier this year I came across quite a few new Hip Hop & Trap artists who are killing it in the city and continuing its long standing musical heritage. The tune is a real viber and is carried along by a poppin'; head knockin'; beat that makes you simply wanna get up and move. The albums out on Young Dolph';s Paper Route Empire and is well worth a check!
