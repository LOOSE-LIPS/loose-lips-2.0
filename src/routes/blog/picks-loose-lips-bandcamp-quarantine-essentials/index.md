![image](../imported/picks-loose-lips-bandcamp-quarantine-essentials/image1049.jpeg)_Times are tough. Money is tight. Boris Johnson has promised things will be different this time, that the Tories won';t screw over workers in the way they did last time we had an economic crash (having recently announced a budget not far off from that which they mocked Labour for a few months ago), but things won';t get any easier for independent artists any time soon. Thankfully, the most artist-friendly platform, bandcamp, has decided to drop its fees for the day, so we thought it would be a great time to highlight a few of our favourite low key releases. If at all possible, please do reach into your pockets._

Give it a listen and you';ll see what I mean._"true to his insatiable avarice"_'; Jack Hunter

Circula, the genius behind our first ever full [solo release';](https://looselips123.bandcamp.com/album/ll011-circula-thought-reel-2)on the Loose Lips label, has just today dropped loads of his beautiful and mysterious jams from 2011-2015, because of Bandcamp';s efforts today to support struggling artists.';  
Dubs galore from an old friend! Gritty, reminiscent of growing up in Devon, getting into bass music of all kinds.'; Medallion Man

Legendary move!'; Joel Baker<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3141788762/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/track=174628759/transparent=true/'></iframe>I actually punched the air when this was released on bandcamp, pure fucking warmth and idealism ready for anyone who needs something to sweeten the queue outside Iceland (it';s a fuckin big one lads). Seriously though music isn';t an artform its magic, turn to it now and take it seriously as medicine for the mental trials we face in the coming months. Also check out our Deep Cuts articles, for music plus that other special special medicine; human connection (via empathy). (This track features in our next Deep Cuts mix, out tomorrow).'; Will Soer

I cried tears of blood but they became low quality chalets in pointins instead of brick house';s. Nothing like a high bpm firestarter to loose your fucking mind to, when you';re self isolating and making your neighbours cry.'; Howard Made

It';s not just the glockenspiel';s sweet melody, but the whole character of the track reminds me of a child: It';s friendly and joyful, but also restless, with its own mind, stretching itself into corners where it crunches and curiously exploring sounds and effects – what happens when I do this?'; Zuzana Friday

These guys, on the other hand, from Almada-based Cuscus collective, must be having a hard time… they';re super active, constantly throwing events or workshops or radio shows or making music. So pump up Pam.demi.CK';s _Frita Kali';_and dance as if it were 1967 in Ibiza. Kali is out there and she';s mad. Stay safe everyone!'; Clara Tehrani

In this time of solitude, I';ve mostly found solace in dark dnb, but this one here does the trick, too, giving some analog warmth and leaving me with a bit more grit and hope.'; Max Dade

Favourite one on this is also the oldest one, made in the early 2010s, _Next Millenium_ is a classy euphoric rush with the typical smoothness that Rico has perfected over the years. It also includes 3 remixes by Alavux, Penso Amor Digo Fúria and my homie Kronom. FTM has been a halt for a half year but there';s lots of things coming  
your way, we just had to step back to jump further!'; T-Scale
