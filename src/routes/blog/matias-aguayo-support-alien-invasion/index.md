![image](../imported/matias-aguayo-support-alien-invasion/image836.jpeg)[Matias Aguayo](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/matiasaguayo), German-Chilean producer/DJ and founder of the [Cómeme](https://soundcloud.com/comeme) label, releases his first album in six years! Well, for anyone fond of Aguayo';s productions, he';s always been a bit of a stickler for the unusual and groovy in the same hand. For me, listening back to some of his earlier releases on both Coméme and [Kompakt](http://www.kompakt.fm), it is the psychedelia within the samples — ethnographic in nature — ';psychedelic and colourful, that set him apart from a sea of techno monochrome. Six years later, Aguayo has returned, perhaps more tripped out than ever, back from the wilderness with an alien vision and ready to tell that tale. ';<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=879490178/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1692828727/transparent=true/'></iframe>With the right layer of psychoactive dust, the _Support Alien Invasion LP_ could be considered a message _to_ the aliens. Pursuing a non-linear path in which he lets experiments form the basis of the nine compositions on this record, it';s pretty clear that this is not your bog-standard linearist dance music. Filled with hypnotic and reversed loops, tribal toms and sawtoothed synths, the twisted, helter-skelter grooves are precisely those that allow the trance to take hold at the witching hour. However, no matter how unusual this may sound, the tracks on _Support Alien Invasion_ are listenable, accessible, danceable. Above all, they probe new boundaries and represent the explorations of a well-rounded artist testing new boundaries of dance.';Support Alien Invasion is due to be released on May 24 on [Cómeme](https://musicacomeme.com) and Crammed Discs.';The LP is also available on Matias Aguayo';s';[Bandcamp](https://matiasaguayo.bandcamp.com/)';page.';
