Kicking off an events and mix series back in 2017, [Gabriella](https://www.instagram.com/gabriella.djuk/)';s experience over the decade '; beginning as a Sheffield curator before expanding to London '; means their talent showcase always reflects who to look out for from all colours of the club music spectrum. It';s only natural they';d evolve into a label.The third EP from Peachy Sounds is a continuation of the dubstep bass weight roots they delivered on their first two records, but from a newer name commencing a journey into production – Lara. The co-founder of UK Bass Music opens with trippy, Eastern-tinged strings on ‘Many Lives'; before vocals from Sutty takes proceedings to a soulful, sultrier dimension on ‘Common Sense';. ';‘Notice Now'; closes the three track EP on a sinister, moodier note, skittering drums and claps cascading over a rolling bassline.
