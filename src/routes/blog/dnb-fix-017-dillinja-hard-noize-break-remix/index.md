![image](../imported/dnb-fix-017-dillinja-hard-noize-break-remix/image1140.jpeg)_If I could pick one track to use as an example of Dillinja';s genius, it would be ‘Hard Noize';. 22 Years after its original release on Test Recordings it returns May 29th as a remix by Break on Dillinja';s imprint Valve Recordings._2020 has been difficult for many people so far. However, one positive to come from this unprecedented lockdown is the deluge of new and old music being released that was never previously available to the masses. One such track is Break';s remix of Dillinja';s epic dancefloor erupting classic ‘Hard Noize'; that is finally seeing a release on Dillinja';s imprint Valve Recordings. It is accompanied by another stellar production from Break named ‘Tubes';. After some Covid-related delays, the release had to be pushed back, however, as of tomorrow May 29th it will be available for purchase and download (something myself and many others have been eagerly anticipating for years).

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFNfVtuqvLU'></iframe>Originally coming out in 1998 on Test Recordings (Dillinja and Lemon D';s label) alongside Lemon D';s ‘Fluid';, the record was mislabelled leading purchasers to believe that the track was actually Fluid and not Hard Noize. The creepy intro to the tune is sampled from an episode of the mystical 1960';s TV show ‘The Twilight Zone';.The remix has been teased in Break and Dillinja sets for several years leaving many a raver mind-boggled by the sheer jaw-dropping standard of production of the classic late 90s roller. The original is, in my opinion, one of the best tracks from the Golden era. It has firmly stood the test of time and will continue to be one of the tracks that typify the era. That said the Break remix takes the best sounds of the original release and adapts them into a true 21st-century';dancefloor weapon.One of only a handful of artists to be asked to officially remix a Dillinja tune and it is clear why Break has been afforded the honour.Dillinja – Hard Noize (Break Remix) is available May 29th from [Bandcamp](https://dillinja.bandcamp.com/album/hard-noize-break-remix-tubes)
