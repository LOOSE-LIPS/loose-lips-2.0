However, good can come from spending time away from the club scene, I';ve been listening to music more without needing to consider whether the track is a â€˜club tool'; or how the dance floor would react to it. So here are some tracks with impossibly complex drum programming, or wonderfully weird breakdowns with that little bit extra that _might_ not fully work in a club setting but are perfect for a home listen.

<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/IuYiWvzN2H8?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I can honestly say this is the first time I have heard a tune seamlessly transition from operatic vocals into shaking IDM drums, drums that almost let you settle before throwing in a left field fill and programming a completely different pattern. It';s not too intense but still gives the listener a lot to think about for a living room listen, a perfect tune for your isolation club blues.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/oWupAFivEoc?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I picked this purely because it';s some of the most interesting production on a rap tune I';ve heard for a while. The basis of the track is simple two-step, but the synths, fills, and some of the textures thrown in on top of that straightforward base-level are amazing. There';s also a really cool remix of the track by LYZZA with more of a club feel.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/mkMlvRW4foU?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I was shown this track by a friend before quarantine started and remember thinking it was amazing. I forgot about it for a few weeks and then found it on my USB midway through [my latest Threads Radio show](https://soundcloud.com/threadsradio/confession-booth-w-xmtr-02-apr-20?fbclid=IwAR1TFuuyl5p7wtT4wLTif1P64HCRcptDQExYXVW6uM-ZdPdgHlL9vKpBicE), it was the perfect way to finish up the set and I';ve been listening to it a few times a day ever since. It';s such a well balanced track, no element overpowers another, perfect to listen to on high volume in the comfort of your own isolation chamber.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/s4iwe9clEWg?wmode=opaque'></iframe>From the delicate drums of Laughing Ears we now move to something with a bit more weight. The drums on this 2019 release from Yilan are built for a club sound system, but on AMAZONDOTCOM';s remix of the track they are warped and syncopated into new rhythms more suited to be the soundtrack of an art installation about paranoia. The rest of the tracks on the release are amazing too, so definitely check those out after listening to this one.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/f5BKcMNY32U?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Ever since the new Andrea LP came out on Ilian Tape a few days ago I';ve been rinsing the whole thing, but this track especially stands out. It builds so beautifully and the heavy drums are balanced so well with the more airy strings and pads. The whole album is absolutely amazing too, tracks like Liquid and Drummzzy are similarly impressive.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/6WA7Q1C4nmc?wmode=opaque'></iframe>I couldn';t do a list of music I';ve been listening to recently without a track from Minor Science';s new album. This is one of my favourite tracks on the Whities release, but as with a lot of the other tracks on this list, the rest of the album is also amazing. Minor Science blends some of his more signature elements with tones that almost sound like they';re from trap beats, the result is incredible.[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=excds_8T9lo)<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/excds_8T9lo?wmode=opaque'></iframe>The last few of my picks are going to be slightly more in line with what I';d usually play as a DJ, but don';t worry, all these tracks are still perfect for a home listen. This track by THUGWIDOW has some amazingly airy pads, and breaks that hit hard but don';t overpower. Some sections of the track feel completely dance floor ready, and others exist in a dark mid space, with elements of jungle, mixed with a more dark ambient feel. Along with this tune the rest of the music Circadian Rhythms are releasing as a label at the moment is really interesting and definitely worth a listen.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/zL6sZcH6Dbo?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Whilst not released as recently as the THUGWIDOW track,  
';C\_C\_E\_D from UVB-76 heavyweight Karim Maas moves in a similar way, feeling at  
';some points like a club tool, and at others like a dark, ethereal soundscape of  
';pads and texture. One of the parties I was planning to go to before the  
';lockdown was a UVB-76 night at Space 289 with a live set from him, so this tune  
';has been serving as a replacement.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/Jk-sMpvU8Bo?wmode=opaque'></iframe>Have you ever been physically assaulted by a breakbeat? You have now. This track is one of the craziest bits of jungle I';ve heard in my life, it builds like it';s going to be a synth driven, liquid Drum and Bass track, before going in a completely different direction with some of the most complex and bewildering breaks you';ll ever hear. I recently managed to buy a copy of the record and have played it in every mix I';ve done over the last few weeks.<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='//www.youtube.com/embed/g5gr5NWZS2Y?wmode=opaque'></iframe>While a lot of these tracks aren';t necessarily made for the club, some of us need a bit of a dance in quarantine occasionally, so my last tune will provide you with just that. Fiesta Soundsystem';s recent release on Warehouse Rave Records is definitely one of the best in terms of breaks and bass I';ve heard in the last year, and Bken Lkage is a complete weapon. Skip to five minutes in and you';ll see what I mean. He also has loads of amazing unreleased stuff that should be coming out in the next few months, definitely one to watch.Mix Tracklist1.XMTR '; ???
