![image](../imported\howard-mades-sunday-jams-mariah-carey-fantasy\image1061.jpeg)BOOM! Instant hit of serotonin raaaaa there, this is the first tune off her 1995 album _Daydream_. Mariah the biggest diva we know, I love it.

Not so much these days, her voice has been notoriously questionable for years now, but never the less, I respect her delusions and what she has done for pop music.
