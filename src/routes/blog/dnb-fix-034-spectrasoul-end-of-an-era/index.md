![image](../imported/dnb-fix-034-spectrasoul-end-of-an-era/image1304.jpeg)_14 years after Jack Stevens and David Kennett joined forces to create a plethora of the most iconic Drum & Bass tracks in existence, they have finally called it a day._Spectrasoul, the duo behind masterpieces such as ‘Away With Me';, ‘Glimpse'; and ‘Burst'; alongside multiple high profile remixes and collaborations with the industries top tier producers, announced on social media that they are retiring the alias to pursue solo projects. It is a huge loss for the scene, with the pair having such a substantial impact on Drum & Bass and electronic music in general for the last 14 years – but all good things must come to an end.

But for now, it seems they will be concentrating on exploring their own aliases; with Jack producing under his ‘Workforce'; alias and releasing on his label ‘Must Make Music'; for a few years now.If you want to keep up with their movements Jack';s podcast ‘Must Make Podcast'; is very interesting and dives into the realm of creative process with Jack and other talented producers such as DBridge, Alix Perez, LSB and more.

Scores of ravers will admit that a Spectrasoul collab or remix holds the position of being their favourite tune to hear on a dancefloor. Of course, these tracks will exist forever, and Jack and David have our eternal thanks for creating them.Hopefully, we will be back listening to them in large sweaty rooms alongside our friends again soon.Spectrasoul 2006-2020
