The sound of MANSUR navigates between the waters of musical fantasy and reality '; it morphs and blends traditional instrumentation with modern day electronica.Using kalimba, violin, cello, ney, erhu, zhonghu, jinhu, kemenche, dilruba, bansuri, rammerdam, double bass and various percussive instruments such as cajon, castanets, krotal and various organic shakers and drums MANSUR leads the listener into mystical and magical unknowns, that lie far past the realms of material perception. The result is a new unique sound which is at the same time warm, dark, misty, cosmic, mystical, cinematic and dynamic. It';s an escapist journey.
