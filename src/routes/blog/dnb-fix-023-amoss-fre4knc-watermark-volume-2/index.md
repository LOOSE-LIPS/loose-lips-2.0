![image](../undefined)_On their own Amoss and Fre4knc are fantastic producers, but when they join forces they show time and time again why they are up there with the most acclaimed producers in the scene right now._Amoss and Fre4knc return to Dispatch Recordings to follow up with the second instalment of their Watermark release series. Watermark Volume 1 was released two years ago and contained heavy bangers such as ‘Planarian'; and ‘Animal Rain';, now they';re back with Dispatch again to up the ante. The pair have recruited Dutch vocalist Swift once again after he featured on the first Watermark EP, after all… if it ain';t broke, don';t fix it!<iframe width='100%' height='300' scrolling='no' frameborder='no' allow='autoplay' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hAAl8XKonM'></iframe>It';s difficult to pick out a standout track as all 4 are excellent productions with the superior level of sound design that you would expect from a track produced by these two. ‘Confront'; and ‘Dragger'; would do damage to any dancefloor but ‘Question Answer'; takes it for me, proper aggressive dark and techy D&B that makes subtle additions to the track as it progresses.Dispatch has already alluded towards a third instalment in the series which is literally music to our ears. When Amoss and Fre4knc link up, you just know that its about to go down.';
