The Advent (Cisco Ferreira) delivers his first full-length Electro album in 17 years. Released this May on Sync 24';s burgeoning Cultivated Electronics label, ‘Life Cycles'; finds the past meeting the future. Because, to get a truer feel for this new long-player, we should head back even further to a 1995 classic – The Advent';s debut album, ‘Elements Of Life';. In fact, fans will recognise a nod to the original artwork of that seminal release, as ‘Life Cycles'; takes us full circle, containing unreleased Electro gems from the ‘90s, available for the first time.
