![image](../imported/kortzers-sunday-jams-dusty-springfield-son-of-a-preacher-man/image758.jpeg)This Week I';ve chosen an absolute classic, Dusty Springfield '; Son of a Preacher Man. I could listen to this track on repeat all day & didn';t actually realise that Dusty was British until today! Her soft sensual style of singing is the perfect sound to serenade any Sunday with! Released in 1968 the track was recorded in none other than Memphis, Tennessee home of the blues. I hope the sweet sound of Dusty can sooth your Sunday headache!
