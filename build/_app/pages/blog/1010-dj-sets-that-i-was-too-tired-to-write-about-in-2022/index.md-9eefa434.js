At the very end, OK Williams was playing some big housey tune, blended it into a looped beat, this big bumping tribalistic rrrrraaaaaawwwwr type of vibe, and then slowed that beat down, unlooped it, and allowed the track to reveal itself as Gimme More by Britney Spears (although my partner had already worked this out, come on Will you know this, I walk to this song so often).
